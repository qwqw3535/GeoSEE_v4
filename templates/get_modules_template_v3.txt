You have access to a set of modules that can provide various kinds of information about a given region. 
Your task is to determine which modules to call to gather information that helps answer a question. 
You will reason step-by-step, documenting your thoughts and the logic behind choosing each module. 
Ultimately, you will stop once you have collected sufficient information.

Available Modules:
<MODULE_DESC>

Question: <QUESTION>

Use the following format enclosed in --- to solve the above question.

---
Thought: [Think aloud about what data might help answer the question. Consider which modules might yield information relevant to understanding or estimating regional GDP. Provide the reasoning steps here.]
Action: [Based on the reasoning, choose a single module to call next. Justify why this module is needed and how it helps with the question. Then write the module call, e.g. get_population(Loc).]

Thought: [Reflect on additional data needed. Do you need to call more modules to strengthen your inference about regional GDP?]
Action: [Select another module if necessary, and provide reasoning just as above.]

… repeat the Thought/Action pattern as needed …

Thought: [Once you believe you have collected enough information to address the question, decide to stop.]

The total list of selected modules:
1. [First module called]
2. [Second module called]
