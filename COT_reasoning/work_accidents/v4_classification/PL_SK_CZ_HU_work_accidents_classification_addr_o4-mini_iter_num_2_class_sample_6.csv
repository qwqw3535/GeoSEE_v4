2,Based on its location—a small semi‐rural settlement in the industrially influenced Silesian voivodeship but without heavy‐industry concentrations like those around Zawiercie—I would classify the expected accident‐at‐work level for ulica 907 42-286 Koszęcin Lubliniecki Śląskie POL as Medium.
3,"Answer: Low

Ligota Łabędzka is a small rural village in the Gmina Rudziniec of the Gliwice district. Although it lies within the highly industrialized Silesian Voivodeship the immediate locality is agricultural and residential rather than heavy‐industry based. All other small villages in our sample (Czołki Niwiski Bolemin) scored “Low” with only larger industrial or mining towns rising to “Medium” or above. Therefore “Low” best fits the expected accident-at-work level for Ligota Łabędzka."
