70,Very Low
71,Very Low
72,Based on its size industrial profile and comparison to similarly‐sized urban/industrial areas in the sample (e.g. Szczecin borough → High) Južné Mesto in Košice IV is best classified as: High.
73,Based on Prague 10’s largely service-and office-based economy (fewer heavy‐industry or agricultural worksites) its strong regulatory environment and safety culture I would classify the expected accident-at-work rate there as Low.

High"
81,"Based on the regional economic profile of Královéhradecký kraj—marked by a mix of light manufacturing machinery construction and a significant tourism sector—and comparing it to the benchmarks (where Pardubický kraj scores “Very High” and more rural or lightly industrialized areas score “Low” or “Very Low”) Královéhradecký kraj falls in the mid‐range.

82,"Based on Vysočina’s economic profile and comparing it to the benchmarks:  
– Pardubický kraj (heavy industry chemical plants transport hubs) was judged “Very High.”  
– Regions with mixed light manufacturing and agriculture (e.g. Lubuskie in POL) fell into “Medium.”  

Vysočina is largely rural with small-to-medium manufacturing wood-processing and agricultural enterprises and lacks the heavy-industry concentration that drives “Very High” accident levels. Its accident-at-work rate therefore aligns with a “Medium” class.
