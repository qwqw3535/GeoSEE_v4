75,"Answer: Very High

The Moravskoslezský kraj is the Czech Republic’s most industrialized and mining‐intensive region with large steelworks coal mines and heavy manufacturing sites around Ostrava and Nový Jičín. These sectors consistently report among the country’s highest rates of occupational injuries. Given that a similarly industrial Pardubický kraj location was classified “Very High” it is reasonable to infer that Výškovice u Slatiny in Moravskoslezský kraj also falls into the “Very High” category for accidents at work."
