10,Very Low
11,Based on Barcin’s profile—a small industrial town in the largely rural Żniński powiat of Kujawsko-Pomorskie with only moderate levels of heavier industry and workforce concentration—the expected accident-at-work indicator aligns with the “Low” class.

36,Based on the pattern observed in Łódzkie Voivodeship (e.g. Sulejów/Piotrkowski marked as High) and considering Zgierski’s mixed rural–peri-urban character with significant light-industry and construction activity (both sectors with elevated work-accident incidence) Opole (gmina Parzęczew powiat Zgierski Łódzkie) is best classed as High.

66,"Based on its scale industrial profile (notably the automotive plants around Trnava) and comparing with the benchmarks above (rural‐Very Low mid‐size city–Low to Medium heavy‐industry zones–High) Trnava’s accident‐at‐work level falls squarely in the medium band. 

Final answer: Medium"
67,For Bobot (a small village in the Trenčín Region of Slovakia) I would place its expected accident-at-work level in the “Medium” class. This region’s overall workplace‐accident rates are higher than those in rural Poland but below the very high levels seen in some Czech areas and Bobot’s small scale and semi-rural character keep it from the top tiers.
68,Based on its largely rural/agrarian character within the Nitra Region (Nové Zámky district) and comparing to the very‐low accident rates seen in similar small‐village settings elsewhere Veľká Maňa would be classified as “Very Low.”
69,Based on its location in the Žilina Region (Dolný Kubín district)—a largely rural mountain‐adjacent area with small‐scale industry and agriculture but without the heavy forestry or dense urban manufacturing that drive very high incident counts—I would classify Žaškov’s expected workplace‐accident level as Medium.
70,"Based on Mýtna’s small‐village largely rural/forestry setting in the Lučenec district (Banskobystrický kraj)—much like the other sparsely populated low‐industry locations that were all judged “Very Low”—we would likewise classify its expected accident-at-work level as:

Answer: Very Low"
71,Based on the fact that Terňa lies in the largely rural less‐industrialized Prešov Region (where overall workplace activity and hence absolute accident counts tend to be below the national average) I would classify its expected number of occupational accidents as Low.

78,Answer: Medium
79,"Based on Ústecký kraj’s above-average industrial activity (mining heavy manufacturing) and its historically elevated workplace accident rates—despite Lukov itself being a small village—the appropriate classification for 418 04 Lukov Ústecký CZ is:

Answer: High"
80,Based on the location being in the largely rural tourism‐ and light‐industry‐oriented Liberec Region (as opposed to heavy‐industry areas like Pardubice or major urban centres) its work‐accident indicator is best classified as Medium.
81,Answer: Medium
