44,Based on its rural low‐industrial profile similar to the other small‐village examples Netta Druga would be classified as: Low.
45,Low
46,Based on the fact that Trzepowo Nowe is a small primarily agricultural village in Płock County (outside the urban/industrial core of Płock city) – and comparing to similar rural Polish locations in the provided benchmarks – we would place its workplace‐accident level in the “Low” category.
47,Based on its location in the largely rural Makowski district of Mazowieckie and by analogy with similar small‐gmina areas in that voivodeship (e.g. Mokobody–Siedlecki: Low) the accident‐at‐work indicator for Modzele Młynarze Makowski Mazowieckie POL would also be classified as Low.

61,Based on its location in the urban service-and‐tourism–oriented Podgórze district of Kraków (Małopolskie) where industrial/ manual‐labour activity is moderate and most work is in lower-risk service sectors the expected accident-at-work level is: Medium.
62,Low: Kąty Goździejewskie is a small rural village in Dębe Wielkie (Miński district Mazowieckie). Its economic profile and population density are similar to Niwiski (also Mazowieckie) and Czołki (Lubelskie) both classified as Low. The limited industrial or large‐scale commercial activity suggests a relatively low incidence of workplace accidents fitting the “Low” benchmark.
