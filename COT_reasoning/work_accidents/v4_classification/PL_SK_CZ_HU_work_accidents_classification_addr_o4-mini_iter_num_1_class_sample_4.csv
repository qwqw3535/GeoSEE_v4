Ligota Łabędzka leży w powiecie gliwickim w województwie śląskim – jednym z najbardziej uprzemysłowionych regionów Polski o relatywnie wysokim wskaźniku wypadków przy pracy. W oparciu o założone klasy jakościowe i porównanie z przykładami z innych województw (gdzie np. Dolnośląskie osiągnęło „Medium”) dla Śląska uznajemy kategorię: „High”."
4,Based on Katowice’s strong industrial base and urban workforce (even in largely residential districts like Brynów-Osiedle Zgrzebnioka many people commute to heavy‐industry or manufacturing jobs) the expected level of work‐related accidents is elevated but not quite at the peak seen in a capital district like Praga-Południe.  I therefore assign it to the “High” class.
5,Based on its location in a small village within the industrially‐oriented Zawierciański district of Silesia—where local employment still leans on higher‐risk manufacturing and extractive activities rather than purely agricultural work—I would classify Rokitno Szlacheckie’s expected accident-at-work rate at the “Medium” level.
6,Low

52,Low. Świlcza is a small suburban/village locality in Rzeszów County with predominantly small businesses agriculture and commuter population lacking major heavy‐industry employers that would drive up workplace accident rates. As such its expected accident‐at‐work level aligns with the “Low” benchmark.

74,Based on Južné Mesto’s location—as a large primarily residential district on the outskirts of Košice (Slovakia’s second-largest city with a notable industrial heritage) and by analogy to similar urban/industrial areas in the region—I would place its expected workplace accident incidence in the “High” category.
75,Answer: Very High
