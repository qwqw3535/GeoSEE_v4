22,"Answer: Low

Justification:  
• Radzie (a small village in the Giżycko district of Warmińsko-Mazurskie) is a predominantly rural area with limited industrial or construction activity.  
• Similar-sized settlements in the same region (e.g. Ramsowo in Barczewo and Rynarcice in Rudna) were both classified as “Low” reflecting low workforce density and minimal heavy‐industry exposure.  
• Tourism around the Masurian Lakes brings seasonal service jobs but does not substantially raise typical workplace‐accident rates.  
• There are no major manufacturing plants large‐scale farms or high‐risk industries nearby.  

Therefore the expected level of work accidents in Radzie aligns with the “Low” benchmark."
