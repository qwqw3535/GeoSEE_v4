2,Based on its location in Mościce – an industrial quarter of Tarnów (a medium‐sized city of ~110 000 in the Małopolskie voivodeship which ranks around the Polish average in per-capita output) – this district’s regional GDP falls into the Medium class.

14,"Based on the fact that Dziembowo lies in Piła County (a mid‐sized moderately industrialized/rural area of Greater Poland Voivodeship) and comparing it to similar county-level examples (e.g. Warmian-Masurian or Lower-Silesian medium-GDP districts) the most appropriate class is:

17,Based on its status as a mid‐sized county seat (around 70 000 inhabitants) a diversified local economy (industry services) but well below the capital’s scale Ostrów Wielkopolski’s district GDP would be classified as: Medium.
18,Based on its location in Grodziski County (a moderately developed peri-urban area in the relatively strong Wielkopolskie voivodeship) and comparing to the qualitative benchmarks (where only Warsaw reaches “Very High” most rural Polish counties are “Low” and those with some industry or proximity to large metros trend “Medium”) Kotusz in Grodziski is best classed as: Medium.

59,"Based on its location in rural Podlaskie (Wysokomazowiecki district)—a region with relatively low economic activity and by analogy to similar Podlaskie settlements (e.g. Studzianki) that were classed as “Low”—the appropriate GDP class for Łopienie-Zyski is:

63,Based on its location in the largely rural Ciechanowski district of Mazowieckie (outside the Warsaw metro‐area) Glinojeck’s gmina would fall into the “Low” class.
64,Based on the patterns above (small‐scale rural gminas in Mazowieckie tending toward “Low” but those in the hinterlands of industrialized or higher-output cities – like Olsztyński vs. Olsztyn – edging into “Medium”) Trzepowo Nowe sits in Płocki powiat which while excluding the city proper benefits from spill-over activity around the Płock oil‐refining centre and is more economically robust than the far-eastern Siedlecki area.  I therefore classify Trzepowo Nowe’s district GDP as Medium.  Answer: Medium
