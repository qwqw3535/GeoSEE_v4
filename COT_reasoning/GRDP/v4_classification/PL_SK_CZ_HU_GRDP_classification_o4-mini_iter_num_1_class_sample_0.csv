52,Based on its location in the rural Zamojski (Sitno) district of Lubelskie – a peripheral low‐GDP county surrounding the city of Zamość – the most appropriate class is Low.
53,Based on its location in the Lublin County just outside the city of Lublin – analogous to other rural‐peripheral districts around a regional capital (e.g. Białostocki Olsztyński) – its likely regional GDP class is Medium.
54,Based on Puławski’s population (~120 000) its mix of industry (notably the large chemical sector around Puławy) and its below‐national‐average per-capita output typical for Lubelskie the county’s total GDP is best classed as Medium.
