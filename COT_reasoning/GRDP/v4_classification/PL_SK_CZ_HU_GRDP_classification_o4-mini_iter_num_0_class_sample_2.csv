Reasoning:
Stary Widzew is a district within the city of Łódź one of Poland’s largest urban centers (3rd by population) with a diversified industrial base significant service-sector employment and higher income levels than the surrounding Łódzkie countryside. In the benchmark scale purely rural or small‐town areas of Łódzkie scored “Low–Medium” while major‐city districts (analogous to central Prague scoring “Very High” or Holasice/Brno‐area scoring “High”) fare better. Łódź’s urban economy is broadly comparable to other regional metro hubs (e.g. Wrocław or Kraków) which we classify as “High.”"
