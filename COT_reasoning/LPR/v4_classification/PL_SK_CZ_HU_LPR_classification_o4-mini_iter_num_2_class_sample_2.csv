14,Based on its location in the Kujawsko‐pomorskie Voivodeship – a mid‐ranking region in terms of economic activity and labour‐market engagement – and comparing it to the benchmarks (Lubelskie = Medium Łódzkie/Śląskie = High etc.) Wieniec Zalesie in the Brześć Kujawski/Włocławek area is best classed as High.
15,"Answer: High

Reasoning:  
· Region context – Daninów is a small rural village in Gmina Kazimierz Biskupi Konin county in the prosperous Wielkopolskie province.  
· Comparison with benchmarks – Eastern-Lubelskie rural areas scored “Medium” central-Łódzkie rural areas scored “High” and rural localities near mid-sized or large urban centres in wealthier provinces typically score “High” or above.  
· Local economic profile – Residents benefit both from agriculture and strong commuting links into Konin’s industrial and service jobs.  
· Conclusion – Labour force participation is expected to be above average but not in the very top tier fitting the “High” class."
