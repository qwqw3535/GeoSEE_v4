Answer: High"
3,Very High
4,Very High
5,Based on its profile as a small rural locality in the industrialized Silesian voivodeship—and by analogy to the other Polish villages rated “High”—Rokitno Szlacheckie would likewise be classified as: High

High"
7,High
8,"Answer: High

Rationale: Rydułtowy Górne lies in the industrialized Wodzisławski county of Śląskie where labour‐force participation rates typically exceed the national average (often around 60–65%). Its proximity to local employment hubs in the Silesian conurbation coupled with relatively low out‐migration of working‐age residents aligns it with regions previously classified as “High.”"

15,High
16,"Based on its location – a rural village in Włocławski county (Kujawsko-pomorskie) within commuting distance of the mid‐sized city of Włocławek – the labour-force engagement is likely above average for rural Poland but not at the very highest tier.

21,High
22,Based on the location – a small rural settlement in the relatively less‐developed Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodeship – and by comparison with similar Polish districts (e.g. Lubelskie yielding “Medium” other remote northern/rural areas tending not to drop below “Medium”) the labour force participation rate class for Radzie Wydminy Giżycki Warmińsko-mazurskie POL is: Medium.

26,"Based on the region’s overall economic activity—Zachodniopomorskie being more developed than the eastern provinces but just below the very top‐performing voivodeships (Mazowieckie Łódzkie)—and the strong local employment hubs around Goleniów/Szczecin the labour‐force‐participation rate for ulica Bolechowo in Goleniów gmina would best be classed as:  
High."

39,Based on the rural low‐density tourism‐and‐conservation character of the Bory Tucholskie National Park area (Chojnicki powiat Pomorskie) you’d expect a somewhat constrained year‐round labour market but still a core working‐age population engaged in forestry tourism and services.  That points to a “Medium” labour force participation rate.  Answer: Medium.

51,High
52,Based on the address Gruszka Zagnańsk in the Kielecki district (Świętokrzyskie voivodeship) we’d expect a moderate (neither very low nor very high) labour‐force participation rate.  In contrast to the very high rates seen in commuter belts around Warsaw or Łódź but somewhat stronger than the more remote pockets of Lubelskie Gruszka’s proximity to Kielce and its mixed rural/industrial character point to a “Medium” participation rate.  Answer: Medium.
