Answer: High"
25,"Based on its rural‐peripheral character in Polish terms (small village in a mid‐sized county rather than a major urban centre) yet aligning with the pattern that most Polish villages and small towns fall into the “High” participation bracket rather than “Low” or “Medium” the labour force participation rate for Konotop Drawsko Pomorskie Drawski Zachodniopomorskie POL is best classified as:

49,Answer: High
50,Based on its setting—a small rural village in the Mazowieckie province with an agriculture-driven local economy but still within commuting distance of larger centres—a labour-force participation rate at the “High” level is the most plausible classification.
51,"Based on its rural location in Świętokrzyskie (a lower‐GDP aging province) but following the pattern for Polish villages (which generally fall into the “High” labour‐force‐participation bracket) Gruszka should be classified as:

Answer: High"
52,High
53,Low. The Podkarpackie‐Bukowsko area is a remote rural locality in one of Poland’s less‐developed regions with limited local employment opportunities and higher rates of economic inactivity placing its labour force participation in the “Low” category.
54,Based on the region’s relatively lower economic activity (Podkarpackie is Poland’s poorest voivodeship with labour‐force participation around the mid-50 percent range) and comparing to the provided Polish benchmarks Otałęż (Czermin Mielecki Podkarpackie) most plausibly falls into the “Medium” labour‐force participation class.
55,High
56,Based on its proximity to the regional centre (Lublin) and by analogy with similarly-sized villages in other Polish provinces (all of which fell into the “High” participation band) Jakubowice Murowane’s labour-force participation rate is best classified as High.
57,Medium
58,"Based on the benchmarks for similar small rural communities in Poland (where most show a “High” participation rate) and despite Lubelskie’s somewhat lower regional GDP the labour‐force participation in Wąwolnica is best classed as:  
High."
59,Based on its location within the industrial district of Mościce in the city‐county of Tarnów (Małopolskie)—an area with above‐average employment opportunities strong manufacturing and services presence and a regional labour‐force participation rate that typically exceeds 60%—the labour force participation rate here falls into the “High” category.
60,Answer: High
61,Based on its role as an active regional centre in Małopolskie—with a diversified local economy tourism services and light industry—and by analogy to similarly sized non-capital Polish cities (e.g. Radom → High) Nowy Sącz would fall into the “High” labour-force-participation class.

79,Based on Karlovarský kraj’s relatively low economic activity (higher-than‐average unemployment aging/retired population in its spa towns like Loket and structural under-employment similar to Jihočeský and Pardubický kraje) its labour-force participation would be classified as Very Low.
80,Answer: Very Low
81,Very Low
82,Based on Dvůr Králové nad Labem’s role as a mid‐sized regional town with a diversified local economy (manufacturing tourism around its famous zoo services) and labour‐market participation rates in Czech regional centres generally running above the national average its labour‐force participation would be classified as High.
83,Based on its location in a small largely rural municipality of the Vysočina Region (which—like other Czech regions in our benchmarks—tends toward the lowest participation band) and in line with the other Czech examples you supplied the labour force participation rate class for 588 21 Velký Beranov Vysočina CZE is: Very Low.

I therefore classify it as Medium.
94,Answer: Low
95,Based on Baranya county’s below‐national‐average participation (roughly mid-50 % versus Hungary’s ~57 %) and given Málom’s rural/edge‐of‐Pécs character its labour‐force‐participation rate best fits into the “Low” category.
