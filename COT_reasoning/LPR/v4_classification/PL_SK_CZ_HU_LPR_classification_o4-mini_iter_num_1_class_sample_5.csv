0,"Based on Glinojeck’s profile as a small largely rural gmina in Ciechanowski county (Mazowieckie) – away from the strong labour markets of Warsaw or Radom and showing similar characteristics to other medium-participation rural municipalities – the most appropriate class is:

Answer: Medium"
1,High
2,Answer: Medium
3,Answer: High
4,"Based on its location in a major urban‐industrial centre (Katowice Śląskie) and comparing to the benchmarks (e.g. central Warsaw districts at “Very High”) Brynów–Osiedle Zgrzebnioka would also be classified as:  
Very High"
5,High
6,High
7,High
8,High
9,"Based on its setting in a small rural Podkarpackie community – similar to the other Polish villages you’ve rated “Medium” (e.g. Ramsowo Rynarcice) – the labour‐force participation rate for Wietlin/Laszki is best classed as:

Answer: Medium"
10,Low
11,Based on its small‐scale predominantly rural character in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie region and by analogy with similar Polish localities (e.g. Ramsowo or Rynarcice which were rated “Medium”) Dębowa Łąka’s labour force participation would also be classified as “Medium.”
12,Based on Barcin’s profile—a small industrial‐agricultural town in Kujawsko-Pomorskie with employment levels and labour‐market engagement close to the national average—the labour force participation rate there is best classed as Medium.
13,"Based on its location in a small largely agricultural/forestry community in Tuchola County (a relatively peripheral part of Kujawsko-Pomorskie) and by analogy with similarly situated Polish districts (which tend to fall in the middle of the participation-rate spectrum) the labour-force participation rate for Wysoka Cekcyn Tucholski Kujawsko-pomorskie would most likely be classified as:

Medium"
14,Based on its location—a small village in the Toruń‐Zławieś Wielka hinterland of Kujawsko‐Pomorskie with moderate commuting ties into Toruń but still largely rural—I would place Toporzysko in the “Medium” labour‐force‐participation bracket.
15,Based on its location in the peri-urban catchment of Włocławek (a city of ~110 000) the largely rural but commuting-enabled gmina of Brześć Kujawski would be expected to have a labour-force participation closer to the higher end of the regional spectrum. Answer: High.
16,Based on its rural setting in Gmina Kazimierz Biskupi (a commuter hinterland of Konin) the regional economic profile of Wielkopolskie and comparison to similarly situated Polish villages Daninów’s labour‐force participation most closely aligns with the “Medium” class.
17,High
18,Answer: Very High
19,Based on Chojno’s location—a small village within the relatively prosperous Wielkopolskie province (Szamotulski/Wronki area) with good connectivity to larger labour markets like Poznań—and by analogy with similar rural localities in strong Polish regions its labour‐force participation rate would be classified as High.
20,Based on its location in the economically strong Wielkopolskie region and its proximity to the city of Ostrów Wielkopolski (which provides ample employment opportunities and commuter links) the labour‐force participation rate for ulica Kołątajew 60-60 63-410 Ostrów Wielkopolski gmina Ostrowski Wielkopolskie POL would fall into the “High” class.
21,Based on Kotusz’s setting—a rural locality in the relatively prosperous Wielkopolskie (Greater Poland) region with good access to both agriculture and nearby industrial/jobs markets in Grodzisk Wielkopolski/Greater Poznań—it would be expected to have a stronger labour‐force participation than the “medium”‐rating rural areas.  Thus the most appropriate class for Kotusz is: High.
22,"Based on its setting—a small village in the Warmińsko-mazurskie voivodeship near the modest labour market of Giżycko (≈30 000 inhabitants) with only limited local industry beyond agriculture and tourism—Radzie’s participation profile aligns with other rural Warmia-Mazury localities (e.g. Ramsowo) which we rated as “Medium.”  

Answer: Medium"
23,Based on its location in rural Warmińsko-mazurskie (similar to Ramsowo Olsztyński) and by analogy to other small Polish villages in your benchmarks Majdany Wielkie’s labour‐force‐participation rate would be classified as Medium.
24,High
25,Medium
26,Based on its rural setting in Goleniów gmina (a moderately developed area near Szczecin) and comparing with similar Polish localities the labour force participation rate is best classified as Medium.
27,Based on its status as a small rural village in a peripheral part of Zachodniopomorskie (a region with modest local employment opportunities and out-migration of younger residents) but noting that Polish villages—even in less‐developed provinces—tend to maintain participation rates around the national average I would classify Bonin’s labour‐force participation as Medium.
28,"Based on its location in rural Podlaskie (Nowe Piekuty in Wysokomazowiecki) which—like similar villages in the Białostocki district—tends to have a relatively strong agricultural employment base and correspondingly high labour‐force participation the most appropriate qualitative class is:  
High."
29,Based on its location in a rural part of the Lwówecki district (Dolnośląskie) which mirrors other small-village examples in this province that we’ve benchmarked as Medium Mojesz’s labour force participation rate is best classified as Medium.
30,Answer: High
31,Based on Wolibórz’s setting—a small village in the Kłodzko (Dolnośląskie) region with a mix of modest local industry agriculture and tourism but limited urban job opportunities—the labour force participation rate would best align with the “Medium” class.
32,Answer: Very High
33,Based on its location—a small village in the Opolskie voivodeship’s Ozimek district similar in character to other rural settlements in Dolnośląskie and Warmińsko-Mazurskie that we flagged as “Medium”—and given Opolskie’s moderate regional labour‐market indicators the estimated labour force participation rate class for ulica Cmentarna 17 46-042 Szczedrzyk is: Medium.
34,Based on its small‐village setting in Nysa County (a modestly sized local centre) the moderate regional economy of Opolskie and typical rural participation patterns in Poland I’d assign Łambinowice a “Medium” labour force participation class.
35,Based on its small‐village agricultural setting in Burzenin commune (Sieradzki Łódzkie)—similar to other rural Polish localities showing moderate workforce engagement—the labour force participation rate for Wola Będkowska 48a is best classified as Medium.
36,Medium
37,Medium
38,High
39,Medium
40,Medium
41,Medium
42,Very High
43,High
44,Based on its setting—a small village in a rural gmina about 15 km from the city of Słupsk in Pomorskie—and by analogy with similar Polish localities (e.g. Ramsowo-Barczewo or Rynarcice-Rudna) that have been judged “Medium” Ochodza’s labour-force participation is best classed as Medium.
45,Answer: Medium
46,Based on Bolemin’s location in the Deszczno commune just outside Gorzów Wielkopolski (a regional labour‐market hub) its proximity to urban jobs and commuting patterns point to a relatively strong labour‐force participation—but not at the very top tier reserved for inner‐city districts like Praga‐Południe.  I would classify it as High.
47,Medium
48,Based on its location—a small village in the Płocki district of Mazowieckie within commuting distance of the larger urban‐industrial centre of Płock—and by analogy to other rural Mazovian localities (e.g. Niwiski in Siedlecki) Trzepowo Nowe is best classified as having a “High” labour‐force participation rate.
49,Based on its location in a small remote rural gmina in Maków County (far from major labour markets) Modzele is likely to exhibit below‐average workforce access and participation. I would therefore classify its labour force participation rate as Low.
50,"Based on its location in a predominantly rural part of the Mazowieckie province (similar to the Niwiski example) and the generally strong labour‐market attachment in that region outside Warsaw the labour force participation rate for Ciemno Gnojna Mszczonów Żyrardowski Mazowieckie POL would be classified as:  

High"
51,Based on its location in a semi‐rural gmina just north of Kielce—with moderate local employment opportunities and by analogy to similarly situated Polish districts (e.g. rural areas near Olsztyn or Lubin classified as Medium)—Gruszka in Zagnańsk (Świętokrzyskie) would be assigned to the Medium labour force participation class.
52,High
53,Based on its location in the relatively under-developed sparsely populated Podkarpackie region—characterized by limited local employment opportunities significant out-migration and below-national-average economic activity—we would place Bełchówka’s labour-force participation in the “Low” category.
54,"Based on its small‐village status in largely rural Podkarpackie (an economically weaker region) but with some local industrial employment around Mielec the labour‐force participation there would most closely align with our “Medium” benchmark.  
Answer: Medium"
55,"Based on its setting as a small predominantly agricultural village in eastern Poland (Lubelskie) and by analogy with other Polish rural localities in our benchmark (which generally fall into the “Medium” class unless they’re in the immediate hinterland of a larger urban centre) the labour‐force‐participation rate in Polubicze Wiejskie is best classified as:  
Medium"
56,High
57,Based on its location – a small village in Gmina Sitno just outside Zamość in the relatively under-developed Lubelskie region – but noting it sits within commuting distance of a mid-sized city (Zamość) the local labour-force participation would be expected to align with other Polish rural areas close to regional centres.  I therefore classify Czołki 14B as “High.”
58,Based on Wąwolnica’s location – a small rural gmina in Lubelskie but with ready access to jobs in nearby Puławy – its labour‐force participation is best classed as Medium.
59,Answer: High
60,High
61,High
62,Based on its location—a small village in the Małopolskie region just outside the town of Nowy Targ—and by analogy with other Polish rural sites in similar‐sized catchment areas (e.g. Radom‐ Barczewo‐ or Rudna‐area villages all classed “Medium”) Morawczyna’s labour‐force participation would be judged Medium.
63,High
64,Very High
65,High

67,Answer: High
68,High
69,High
70,Based on the rural agricultural character of Veľká Maňa in Nové Zámky (Nitra) and its position in Slovakia’s regional participation‐rate rankings (below the national average but not the very lowest) the labour‐force participation there would best be classed as Low.
71,Answer: Medium
72,Very Low
73,Answer: Low
74,High
75,Answer: Very High
76,Based on Průhonice’s status as an affluent Prague‐commuter suburb in the Central Bohemian Region—where employment levels and commuting rates are among the highest in the country—the most appropriate category is: Very High.
77,Very Low
78,Very Low
79,Very Low
80,Answer: Very Low
81,Very Low
82,Based on its size economic base (notably tourism and light industry) status as a district town in a relatively prosperous region and comparison to the provided benchmarks Dvůr Králové nad Labem would fall into the “Medium” labour‐force‐participation class.
83,Based on its small‐municipality rural setting in the Vysočina Region (similar to the other Czech village examples which were all “Very Low”) the labour‐force participation rate for 588 21 Velký Beranov Vysočina CZE would also be classified as Very Low.

86,Very Low
87,Answer: Very High
88,High
89,Based on Seregélyes’s location in Fejér – a relatively affluent industrialized commuter-area around Székesfehérvár and within easy reach of Budapest – its labour‐force engagement is well above the national average but not quite on par with a capital-city district.  I would therefore classify its participation rate as High.
90,High
91,Based on Városlőd’s status as a small predominantly rural village in the Ajka district of Veszprém County—an otherwise moderately developed area in Hungary—and comparing it to the benchmark villages already classified (e.g. Tolna’s Varsád = Very Low; Sz-Sz-B’s Baktalórántháza = Low) its labour‐force participation would be expected to sit above those very low‐participation rural localities but still below urbanized or highly industrialized settings.  Answer: Medium
92,Based on Győr-Moson-Sopron’s status as one of Hungary’s most economically dynamic export-oriented counties (cross-border employment with Austria strong industrial base above-national‐average participation rates) the labour force participation in Barbacs is best classified as: Very High.
93,Medium
94,Based on Söjtör’s small‐village rural setting in Zala (one of Hungary’s less economically active counties) the labour‐force participation rate there would be classified as Very Low.
95,Medium
96,Based on Somogy’s generally below‐national‐average participation rates in small rural settlements (comparable to Tolna or Szabolcs villages) Mezőcsokonya most likely falls into the “Low” category.
97,Low
98,Based on Heves megye’s typically below-national-average labour force participation—particularly in its small rural settlements like Vécs—I would classify its participation rate as Low.
99,Given its location in Nógrád county – one of Hungary’s most economically lagging rural‐outmigration areas with above‐average unemployment and below‐average activity rates – Nógrádsipek’s labour‐force participation would fall into the “Very Low” category.
100,"Based on Ebes’s location in Hajdú-Bihar (a commuter village just outside the regional centre Debrecen which offers significantly more job opportunities than the more depressed eastern‐Hungarian counties) we’d expect its labour‐force participation to sit above the “Low” bracket typical of Baktalórántháza or Varsád but not at Budapest’s “Very High” level. Hence the most plausible class for 4211 Ebes Hajdú-Bihar HUN is:

Answer: Medium"
101,Low
102,Based on Soltvadkert’s location in the predominantly agricultural less industrialized Bács-Kiskun county—comparable to other small Hungarian towns we’ve classified as Low—I would assign its labour force participation rate to the “Low” category.
103,Low
104,Based on Hódmezővásárhely’s role as a regional urban centre (population ~45 000) its labour‐market characteristics sit below the national Hungarian average but well above the rural periphery. Hence its labour‐force participation would best be classed as “Medium.”
