5,Based on Szczyrk’s strong tourism‐driven local economy its location in the relatively well‐developed Silesian Voivodeship and comparators for similar small Polish towns the labour‐force participation rate is best classified as High.
6,Based on the location’s position in the industrialized high-employment Silesian region (a former coal-mining district with strong labour‐market integration) the most appropriate class is: Very High.
7,"Based on the location (a small village in Jarosławski county in one of Poland’s least industrialized voivodeships) and comparing with similar rural benchmarks (e.g. Czołki in Lubelskie was rated Medium) the most plausible labour‐force‐participation class for ulica Wietlin Laszki (Podkarpackie) is:

Answer: Medium"

10,"Answer: High

Dębowa Łąka is a small predominantly agricultural village in Wąbrzeźno County Kujawsko-pomorskie—a voivodeship whose GDP per capita and labour market indicators sit modestly above those of the poorer eastern regions (e.g. Lubelskie which scores “Medium” in Czołki) but below the national leaders (Mazowieckie Pomorskie). Rural participation in this part of Kujawsko-pomorskie typically exceeds the “Medium” benchmark reflecting both a relatively active local workforce and out-commuting to nearby towns. Based on those regional dynamics and the pattern seen in comparable villages the labour force participation rate in Dębowa Łąka is best classified as High."
11,"Based on the regional labour‐market characteristics of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (moderate unemployment a mix of industry and services roughly at or a bit above the Polish national average participation rate) and comparing with the other Polish examples (Lubelskie rural = Medium Lubuskie and Małopolskie rural = High Mazowieckie peri-urban = Very High) Barcin (Żniński Kujawsko-Pomorskie) would best fit into the “High” labour force participation class.  
Answer: High"
12,Based on its rural setting in the Tuchola Forest area of Kujawsko-Pomorskie and by analogy with similarly positioned Polish villages (e.g. Bolemin Morawczyna Rokitno Szlacheckie) Wysoka Cekcyn most likely falls into the “High” labour-force‐participation category.
13,Based on its location in a well-connected economically active hinterland of Toruń (good commuter links mixed agriculture and small industry) and by analogy with similar rural‐commuter districts in central Poland (which we have classified as High) Toporzysko in Zławieś Wielka would likewise fall into the “High” labour force participation bracket.

19,Based on the strong local economy of the Wielkopolskie region (notably its well-developed agri-industrial base around Ostrów Wlkp.) the relatively high employment opportunities in the county and nearby Poznań and by analogy with similarly sized gminas that were rated “High” the labour‐force participation in Ostrów Wielkopolski gmina would be classified as High.

23,Based on its location in the relatively economically weaker rural Warmian-Masurian voivodeship and by analogy with other small Polish villages (e.g. Czołki in Lubelskie was rated “Medium”) Majdany Wielkie would likewise most likely fall into the Medium labour-force-participation category.
24,High
25,Based on its location in the Szczecin commuter‐belt (Goleniów gmina Zachodniopomorskie) with strong access to urban jobs and services you would classify its labour‐force participation as Very High.
26,Based on its location in rural Zachodniopomorskie (near Koszalin) and by analogy with other Western‐Poland villages (e.g. Bolemin Deszczno) the labour‐force participation rate in Bonin (76-009) would fall into the “High” category.
27,"Based on its position in rural Podlaskie – one of Poland’s less economically active aging‐and‐out-migrating regions – we would expect labour‐force participation below the “Medium” benchmark set by Lubelskie.  I therefore assign Łopienie-zyski a classification of:
