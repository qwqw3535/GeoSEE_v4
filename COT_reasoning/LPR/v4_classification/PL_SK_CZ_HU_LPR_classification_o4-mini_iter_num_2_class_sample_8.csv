0,Based on its location in a moderately prosperous labour‐force‐rich Mazowieckie county (albeit outside the immediate Warsaw metro) and by analogy to similar rural gminy in Mazowieckie that score “Very High” but allowing for a slight discount for being further from major urban centres the labour‐force‐participation class for ulica Ościsłowo 30A-30A Glinojeck gmina is best judged as High.

Answer: Medium"
8,Medium
9,Based on the region’s generally modest economic development its rural character and demographic structure (ageing population out‐migration of working‐age residents) Rączki in Włoszczowski powiat Świętokrzyskie voivodeship would most likely exhibit a labour‐force participation rate in the “Medium” range.

51,"Answer: Medium

Explanation:
• Region’s economic context – Podkarpackie is one of Poland’s less affluent voivodeships with GDP per capita and employment indicators closer to the lower end nationally (comparable to Lubelskie).  
• Local settlement type – Świlcza is a village/suburb of Rzeszów. While proximity to the regional capital boosts opportunities the overall regional labour‐force engagement remains below the high‐participation voivodeships (Śląskie Małopolskie) and well below the very high levels seen in Mazowieckie (Warsaw area) or coastal Zachodniopomorskie.  
• Benchmarks – Villages in Lubelskie were assigned “Medium” and poorer eastern regions without metro anchors tend not to exceed this class. Even with commuter links Podkarpackie villages typically fall in the same bracket."
52,Based on its location—a small rural settlement in the relatively under‐developed Podkarpackie region—and by analogy with similar Eastern Polish localities (e.g. Czołki in Lubelskie which we classified as “Medium”) the labour‐force participation rate for Bełchówka Bukowsko Sanocki Podkarpackie POL is best classed as Medium.
53,Answer: Medium
54,Based on its rural setting in eastern Lubelskie—similar to Czołki in Zamoski county—and considering the region’s middling employment opportunities and participation rates the labour force participation in Polubicze Wiejskie would be classified as Medium.
55,Answer: Very High
56,Based on its location in rural Puławy County within Lubelskie (similar to Czołki in Zamojski which was classified Medium) and the region’s typical labour‐force profiles the labour force participation rate for ulica Łopatki 88A-88A 24-160 Wąwolnica Puławski Lubelskie would be classified as Medium.
57,Answer: High

68,Based on its location in the moderately developed Nitra region and by analogy to the given rural‐area benchmarks (Czech very low Hungarian low eastern-Poland medium) Veľká Maňa’s labour‐force participation would most likely fall into the Medium class.
69,Based on Žaškov’s setting—a small rural village in the Dolný Kubín district (Žilina Region) with modest local employment opportunities but not among the country’s most deprived areas—the labour‐force participation is likely around the Slovak average.  I therefore assign it to the Medium class.
70,Based on its small rural‐peripheral character (a tiny village ~10–15 km outside the small town of Lučenec in a relatively low‐activity part of Banskobystrický kraj) yet still within commuting distance of local jobs Mýtna’s labour‐force participation would most closely align with the “Medium” benchmark.
71,Based on Prešov’s relatively low economic activity and high unemployment (the weakest of Slovakia’s regions) you would classify Terňa’s labour‐force participation as Very Low.
72,"Based on Eurostat and national‐level data Košice kraj’s labour‐force participation hovers in the upper-60 percent range – below the “High” threshold but above “Low.”  In our five-class scheme that corresponds to “Medium.”  

Answer: Medium"
73,Very High
74,Answer: Very High. Průhonice lies in Praha-západ just outside Prague within the affluent and highly connected Central Bohemian Region.

79,Very Low
80,Low
81,Answer: High. The Dvůr Králové nad Labem area in Královéhradecký kraj is a mid‐sized urban centre with diversified industry and tourism (notably the zoo and Krkonoše foothill resorts nearby) low regional unemployment and overall participation near or above the national average. In the five‐class scheme (Very Low Low Medium High Very High) it therefore falls into the “High” labour‐force‐participation bracket.

94,Based on Baranya megye’s below-national‐average participation rates (≈ 58 %) only partly offset by Pécs city’s somewhat stronger labour market (≈ 61 %) Málom’s overall labour‐force‐participation best aligns with the “Medium” class.
95,Low
96,Based on Tolna megye’s position in the Southern Transdanubia region (with labour‐force‐participation rates hovering around the mid-50s percent) which is above the low‐participation eastern counties but below the highest‐performing areas the most appropriate qualitative class is Medium.
97,Low
98,"Based on Heves megye’s position as a mid‐performance Eastern Hungarian county – better than the very low‐participation Szabolcs–Szatmár‐Bereg but below Western and Central Hungary – its labour‐force participation aligns with the “Medium” benchmark.
