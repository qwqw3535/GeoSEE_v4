Answer: High"
8,High.
9,Based on its location in a relatively under-developed largely rural part of south-eastern Poland (Podkarpackie Voivodeship Jarosławski County) but still within Poland’s overall labour-market context (where rural areas often show moderate engagement) I would classify ulica Wietlin 37-512 Laszki as having a Medium labour force participation rate.
10,Based on its rural location in one of the less‐developed Polish provinces (Świętokrzyskie) and by analogy with similarly situated villages (e.g. Ramsowo in warmińsko-mazurskie) the labour-force participation in Rączki is best classed as Medium.
11,Answer: Medium
12,Based on Barcin’s size its location in the mid‐range Kuyavian-Pomeranian voivodeship (outside major urban centers like Bydgoszcz/Toruń) and by analogy with similar Polish small towns and surrounding rural districts its labour force participation rate would most closely align with the “Medium” benchmark.

23,Medium
24,Based on Dąbie being a district within Szczecin – one of Poland’s larger regional capitals and a major port city – its labour‐force participation is well above the national average but still a notch below Warsaw’s exceptionally high rates.  I would classify it as: High.
25,Answer: Medium

40,Based on its location in a largely rural tourism‐focused part of Pomorskie – without close linkage to a large urban labor market – but still within a Polish province whose overall participation rates rarely dip into the “Low” band the labour-force participation rate for the Chojnicki district around Bory Tucholskie National Park would best be classed as Medium.
41,Medium
42,Based on its position in a major metropolitan labour market (the Przymorze Małe district of Gdańsk) and benchmarks from other large‐city districts (e.g. Praga‐Południe in Warsaw = Very High) the labour force participation rate for ulica Obotrycka 15-25 80-383 Przymorze Małe Gdańsk Pomorskie POL would also be classified as: Very High.
43,High
44,Based on its proximity to the city of Słupsk (a medium‐sized urban center of roughly 90 000 inhabitants) and by analogy with similarly situated villages around Lubin Siedlce or Białystok—each of which we classified as “High”—we would infer that Ochodza Dębnica Kaszubska Słupski Pomorskie POL also falls into the “High” labour force participation bracket.
45,Based on its location in a relatively remote tourism‐dependent area of Podlaskie (unlike villages clustered around a larger urban centre such as Białystok) Netta Druga’s overall labour‐force participation is best classified as: Medium.
46,High

48,High
49,Answer: Medium
50,Based on its location in the more dynamic Warsaw-commuting belt of central Mazowieckie (similar to Niwiski/Mokobody or Studzianki) and the generally strong participation rates in these peri-urban/rural parts of the province Ciemno Gnojna would also fall into the “High” labour-force-participation category.
51,Based on its rural‐suburban character in one of Poland’s less prosperous voivodeships—mirroring other small villages near mid‐sized centres that we rated “Medium”—I would classify Gruszka (Zagnańsk Świętokrzyskie) as Medium labor‐force participation.

58,High
59,Based on Mościce being an urban‐industrial district of Tarnów (a mid-sized city in Małopolskie) its labour‐force participation would be above average but not at the very top (as in Warsaw).  I therefore classify it as: High.
60,High. Ostrężnica is a small village in Krakowski county just outside Kraków benefiting from strong commuting links into the regional capital. Its proximity to urban job markets and the generally healthy labour‐market conditions in Małopolskie suggest an above-average participation rate consistent with a “High” classification.

68,High
69,Based on Trenčín’s relatively strong economic performance in western Slovakia and its above‐average regional participation rates I would classify Bobot Trenčín SVK as having a “High” labour force participation rate.
70,Based on its setting as a small rural municipality in the Nitra region—analogous to the low‐participation profiles seen in other Central European villages—the labour force participation in Veľká Maňa would most likely fall into the “Low” category.
71,"Based on Žaškov’s status as a small village in the Dolný Kubín district (a rural mountainous municipality with limited local industry or commuting options) its labour force participation most closely resembles the “Very Low” benchmarks seen in similar Czech and Slovak rural localities. 

Answer: Very Low"
72,Based on Mýtna’s location in a relatively under-developed rural part of the Banskobystrický region (historically characterised by high unemployment and lower economic activity) its labour‐force participation would be assessed as Low.
73,Based on Terňa’s location in the relatively less affluent higher‐unemployment Prešov Region of eastern Slovakia—and comparing its likely labour‐force engagement to the provided Central European benchmarks—I would class its labour force participation rate as Low.
74,High
75,Very High
76,"For the municipality of Do Krásy in Průhonice (Praha-západ district Středočeský kraj) we can draw on several observations:

1. Proximity to Prague – one of the most dynamic labour markets in Central Europe – means residents have easy access to a broad array of jobs both in the capital and in the rapidly growing suburbs.  
2. Central Bohemia is the Czech Republic’s strongest-paying region outside Prague with above-average educational attainment and commuter rates.  
3. Unemployment in Praha-západ is among the lowest in the country and local participation in the labour force consistently outpaces the national mean of roughly 75 percent.  

Given these factors and benchmarked against our five qualitative classes (Very Low Low Medium High Very High) Průhonice’s labour force participation would most appropriately be rated as:  

Answer: High"
77,Based on its rural setting in the Moravskoslezský kraj and benchmarking against similar small Czech municipalities the labour force participation rate for Výškovice u Slatiny would be classified as Very Low.
78,Very Low
79,Low
80,Very Low
81,Considering Javorník’s status as a small rural settlement in Liberec Region (a peripheral lower‐density area in the Czech Republic similar in character to the other Czech villages classified above) its labour force participation would fall into the “Very Low” category.
82,Based on its location in a mid‐sized town with diversified local industry and tourism (the famous zoo) and given that rural municipalities in Jihočeský and Pardubický kraje were classed as “Very Low” Dvůr Králové nad Labem in Královéhradecký kraj would most plausibly fall into the “Medium” labour‐force participation category.
83,Very Low
84,Answer: High
85,Very Low
86,High

88,Answer: Very High
89,Medium
90,Medium
91,"Based on Városlőd’s status as a small rural municipality in the Ajka district—despite Veszprém County’s middling economic performance—the labour‐force participation there is still likely below the national average but not at the very bottom.  
Answer: Low"
92,High
93,High
94,Low
95,Based on its location within Pécs – one of Hungary’s larger regional university‐ and industrial centres – Málom’s labour‐force participation will be noticeably higher than in the surrounding rural villages (which we’d class as “Low”) but still below the levels seen in Budapest or other top national hubs.  Under the five‐point qualitative scale Pécs (and thus Málom) best fits into the “Medium” category.
96,Based on Somogy’s relatively low economic development Mezőcsokonya’s rural profile and its likely below-national-average activity rates (similar to other small Somogy/Tolna–region settlements) the labour force participation class is: Low.
97,Low
98,Answer: Low
99,Low
100,Based on Ebes’s location in Hajdú-Bihar (a county anchored by the economically stronger regional hub Debrecen) its role as a commuter village with both agricultural and industrial employment opportunities and comparing to similar Hungarian benchmarks (Tolna and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg towns were Low while areas closer to large cities tend toward Medium) the labour force participation rate in Ebes is best classified as Medium.
101,Low
102,Based on Soltvadkert’s profile—a small wine-tourism town in Bács-Kiskun (one of Hungary’s less developed counties) with a local labour market that tends to lag behind the national average participation rate—I would classify its labour-force participation rate as Low.
103,"Based on Békés county’s generally below-national‐average participation rates (similar to Tolna or Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg counties which we’ve classed as “Low”) Murony in Békés would likewise be classified as:

Answer: Low"
