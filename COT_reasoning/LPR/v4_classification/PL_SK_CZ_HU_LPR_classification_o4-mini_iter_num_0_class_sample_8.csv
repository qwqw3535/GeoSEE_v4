31,"Answer: Very High

Wisznia Mała lies in the Trzebnicki district of Dolnośląskie just north of Wrocław one of Poland’s stronger labour markets. District‐level statistics for Dolnośląskie show above‐average participation rates and proximity to Wrocław’s job opportunities combined with low local unemployment and relatively high commuter flows all point to the top class.
