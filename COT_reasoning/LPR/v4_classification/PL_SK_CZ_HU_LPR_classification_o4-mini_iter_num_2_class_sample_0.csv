6,High
7,Based on Podkarpackie’s generally below‐national‐average participation rates (comparable to Lubelskie which was rated “Medium” for a similarly rural locality) and given Laszki’s rural setting in Jarosławski the labour‐force participation rate most closely aligns with the “Medium” benchmark.

9,Medium
10,Answer: High
11,Based on the economic profile of Żniński county (Barcin’s labour‐market participation running close to the national average but below the top-tier voivodeships) and comparing to your qualitative benchmarks I would classify ulica Polna 88-190 Barcin Kujawsko-Pomorskie as: High.

31,Based on Wolibórz’s rural‐mountainous setting in the Kłodzko region – limited local industry modest commuting opportunities (to Nowa Ruda/Kłodzko) demographic ageing and out-migration – its labour force participation is best classified as Medium.
32,Very High
33,High
34,"Based on its location and regional context Łambinowice (a small town in Nysa County Opolskie) is likely to exhibit a relatively strong labour‐force participation rate. Opolskie’s overall participation runs slightly below the national average but well above the less‐developed eastern provinces. Moreover towns of Łambinowice’s size in this part of Poland typically have enough local employers (light industry services commuting links to Nysa/Opole) to keep participation high.

73,Very High
74,Answer: Very High
75,"Based on the region’s mix of former heavy‐industry employment centres (Ostrava/Nový Jičín) and surrounding villages its labour‐force participation is above the very low rural Czech benchmarks (e.g. Bučina in Pardubický kraj) but still below the urban Czech and Polish High/Very-High norms. I therefore assign Výškovice u Slatiny to the Medium class.  
Answer: Medium"
76,Answer: Medium

79,Based on the Ústecký region’s persistently high unemployment below-average economic activity and historically low labour‐force engagement (among the lowest of all Czech regions) Lukov (Ústí nad Labem – Ústecký kraj) would be classified as Very Low.
80,"Based on the fact that Liberecký kraj’s overall labour‐force participation rate sits around the national average or just above and even though Javorník is a small rural locality (which tends to pull the rate down slightly) you’d still expect it to be around the mid‐range benchmark.  

Answer: Medium"
81,"Based on Dvůr Králové nad Labem’s status as a regional market town with diversified industry and tourism (notably its zoo) its proximity to the regional centre of Hradec Králové and the fact that Hradec Králové Region typically posts above-average participation rates compared to more rural Czech districts the most fitting class is:

High"
