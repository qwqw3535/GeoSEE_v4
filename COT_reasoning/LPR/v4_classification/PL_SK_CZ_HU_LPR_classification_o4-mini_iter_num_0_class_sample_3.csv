4,Based on its location in the urbanized economically active Silesian capital Katowice and comparing to the qualitative benchmarks provided the labour‐force participation rate for Brynów-Osiedle Zgrzebnioka would best be classified as: High.
5,Based on the location’s profile – a small village in Zawiercie County (an area with relatively strong industrial/employment ties in Silesia) and by analogy with other rural‐Polish localities (which generally fell into the “High” bracket except those with outsized commuter links to a major metro) the labour‐force‐participation rate for Rokitno Szlacheckie is best classed as High.
6,"Based on Częstochowa’s profile – an industrial‐urban centre in Śląskie with labour‐force participation around or just above the national average but still below the peak levels seen in Mazowieckie – the most appropriate class is:  
High"
7,Based on its size economic profile (tourism and local services) and by analogy with similar Polish localities Osiedle Zapelenica in Szczyrk would be classified as having a High labour force participation rate.

41,"Based on Przymorze Małe’s location in the third‐largest Polish metropolis – a densely populated economically active urban district with good transport links a strong service sector and a high share of working‐age residents – its labour‐force participation sits at the top of our five‐point scale.  

Answer: Very High"
42,High
43,Based on the location’s rural character in Pomerania—and consistent with the “High” participation rates seen in comparable Polish villages—Ochodza (Dębnica Kaszubska Słupski Pomorskie) would be classified as: High.

48,"Based on the pattern we see across Polish “District”‐level localities—where small rural villages around regional centres almost always fall into the “High” labour‐force‐participation bracket (with only exurban areas immediately adjacent to Warsaw pushing into “Very High”)—Niwiski (Mokobody Siedlecki Mazowieckie) most closely aligns with the “High” class.

59,Based on Mościce’s profile as an urban/industrial district of Tarnów (Małopolskie)—with steady employment opportunities relatively low unemployment and an active commuter workforce—its labour‐force participation falls into the “High” category.

62,Based on its location—a semi-rural community within commuting distance of Kraków—and comparing with similar Małopolskie and suburban areas Kwaczała’s labour force participation would be classified as High.
63,Very High
64,Based on its location as a central Warsaw district with high employment dynamics and drawing from the benchmarked patterns Praga-Południe’s labour force participation rate would be classified as Very High.
65,Based on its location in the suburban ring of Warsaw (Warszawski Zachodni Mazowieckie) which typically exhibits even stronger labour‐force attachment than more peripheral rural districts the labour force participation rate for ulica Błogosławionego Księdza Józefa Stanka 6-6 in Ołtarzew should be classified as: Very High.

70,Based on Žaškov’s location in the rural mountainous Dolný Kubín district of the Žilina Region—where local employment (including tourism forestry small‐scale manufacturing) keeps participation rates around or just below the Slovak average (circa 70 %)—its labour‐force participation would fall into the “High” class.
71,Low

73,Medium
74,Based on its location in the affluent Prague‐West district of the Central Bohemian Region—and given its strong commuter ties to Prague and above‐average employment indicators—Do Krásy in Průhonice would be classified as Very High.
75,Based on the region’s structural decline in heavy industry persistently above‐average unemployment and correspondingly low labour‐force engagement (well below the Czech national mean and on a par with or below South Moravia) Moravskoslezský kraj would be classified as Very Low.
76,Very Low
77,"Based on Plzeňský’s solid industrial base (Škoda Pilsner brewing engineering) and relatively healthy employment rates—yet noting that Prague itself was classified “Low” and Jihomoravský “Very Low”—we’d slot Plzeňský one tier above Prague.

80,Answer: Very Low
81,Based on Dvůr Králové nad Labem’s location in the moderately developed Královéhradecký region—more economically active than rural Moravia (which scored “Very Low”) but less so than metropolitan Prague (scoring “Low”)—its labour‐force participation rate most closely aligns with the “Medium” benchmark.
82,Very Low
83,"Based on the location in a small municipality in the Vysočina Region—characterised by an aging population structure modest local job‐market size but offset somewhat by commuting into Jihlava—I would place Velký Beranov in the middle of the five‐point benchmark. Its labour‐force participation is neither as low as more peripheral villages in Moravia nor as high as suburban or urban districts. 

Answer: Medium"
84,"Based on its location in the Olomoucký kraj and by analogy to the benchmarked spread for Czech regions (Jihomoravský = Very Low Praha = Low) Újezd in Olomoucký kraj would fall into the next category up: Medium. Therefore:

Answer: Medium"
85,Based on its location – a semi-rural village in the immediate commuter belt of the strongly industrialised city of Zlín – we’d expect Podřevnická (Želechovice nad Dřevnicí Zlín) to show labour‐force participation close to or slightly above the Czech regional average (but still below the “High” levels seen in large metropolitan or very prosperous rural areas elsewhere).  I therefore classify it as Medium.
86,High
87,For the commuter‐belt town of Gyömrő in Pest County – given its close integration with the Budapest labour market relatively high local employment rates and above‐average activity levels in the Central Hungary region – the labour force participation rate would be classified as Very High.

89,High
90,Based on its rural character in Veszprém county—similar to other small Hungarian villages like Nógrádsipek—and despite its proximity to Ajka’s light‐industrial area Városlőd’s overall labour‐force participation rate is best classified as Medium.
91,High
92,Based on Sorkifalud’s location in Vas county—a relatively well-performing Western Hungarian region with stronger employment indicators than the national average—I’d classify its labour force participation rate as High.
93,"Based on Zala county’s predominantly rural structure with some medium‐sized urban centres (e.g. Zalaegerszeg) and its labour‐force participation hovering around the national Hungarian average it best fits the “Medium” benchmark. 

Answer: Medium"
94,Answer: Low
95,Based on its location—a small rural village in Somogy County with labour‐market dynamics broadly in line with other Hungarian countryside areas (e.g. Nógrádsipek was classified as Medium)—we’d place Mezőcsokonya at a Medium labour force participation level.
96,Based on its rural setting in Tolna (a mid‐performing county in Hungary) and by analogy with the Nógrádsipek (Medium) I’d classify Varsád’s labour-force participation as Medium.

101,Based on its location in a smaller county town in Bács-Kiskun (a Southern Great Plain region with generally below-average economic indicators though not as depressed as the far northern or eastern rural areas) its status as a modest local service hub (rather than a large urban centre) and by analogy to similarly sized Hungarian settlements (e.g. Nógrádsipek → Medium) the labour-force participation rate here is best classified as Medium.
102,Answer: Medium
