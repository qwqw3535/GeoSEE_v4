50,"Answer: High  
Rationale: Ciemno Gnojna is a small village in the Żyrardowski (Mazowieckie) commuting belt of the Warsaw region. Although rural its proximity to several commuter towns (Mszczonów Żyrardów and Warsaw itself) gives residents solid access to jobs and tends to boost overall participation rates above the national‐rural average. This pattern mirrors other nearby Mazowieckie localities like Niwiski (rated “High”) rather than more isolated or economically weaker villages. Hence “High” is the best qualitative fit."
