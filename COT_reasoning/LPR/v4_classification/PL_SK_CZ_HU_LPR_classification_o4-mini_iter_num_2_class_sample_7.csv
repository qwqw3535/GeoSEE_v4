5,High
6,"Based on its location in the industrialized Silesian Voivodeship (Wodzisławski district) and by analogy with other Śląskie‐region examples (e.g. Częstochowa Rokitno Szlacheckie) we would expect a High labour‐force participation rate.  
Answer: High"
7,Based on Podkarpackie’s below‐average labour‐force participation (especially in its rural gminas like Laszki) I would classify ulica Wietlin Laszki as Low.
8,Answer: Low
9,Based on its location—a small rural settlement in the relatively less‐industrialized Świętokrzyskie voivodeship—and by analogy with similarly sized villages in Łódzkie and Lubelskie that we rated “Medium” Rączki’s labour‐force participation rate is best classified as Medium.

Answer: Medium"

14,Based on the regional pattern of labour‐force participation in rural Poland (with Lubelskie and Łódzkie villages scoring “Medium” Śląskie/Lubuskie/Małopolskie scoring “High” and Mazowieckie/Zachodniopomorskie scoring “Very High”) a small farm‐village in Kujawsko-Pomorskie like Wieniec Zalesie would align with the “Medium” class.
15,Based on its location in a rural gmina within easy commuting distance of Konin (a significant industrial centre in Wielkopolskie) Daninów is likely to exhibit labour‐force participation above the Polish rural average but not as extreme as peri-Capitals like Warsaw or Szczecin.  I therefore classify it as High.
16,"Based on the pattern that villages in western‐central Poland (Wielkopolskie Lubuskie Śląskie Małopolskie) tend to exhibit higher participation rates (e.g. Bolemin Rokitno Szlacheckie and Morawczyna all falling into “High”) while truly peripheral/eastern rural areas are only “Medium” Dziembowo in Pilski (a western‐central agricultural/commuter zone with reasonable access to Piła’s labor market) aligns with the “High” class.
