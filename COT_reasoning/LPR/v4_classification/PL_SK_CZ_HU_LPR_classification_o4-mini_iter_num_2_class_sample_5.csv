0,Based on its location in rural Mazowieckie (which shows very strong labour‐force participation in comparable gminas) I would class ulica Ościsłowo 30A-30A 06-452 Glinojeck as Very High.
1,High
2,High. Given its location in Śląskie—a region characterized by strong industrial employment and consistently high participation rates in our benchmark set—Koszęcin’s local labour force participation would be classified as High.
3,High
4,"Based on Katowice’s status as a major urban and industrial centre with very strong labour‐market engagement the labour force participation rate class for ulica Tadeusza Kościuszki Brynów-Osiedle Zgrzebnioka Katowice is:

Very High"
5,High
6,Based on its location in the Śląskie region (an industrial area with above‐average labour‐market engagement) and by analogy with the other Śląskie examples (e.g. Częstochowa Rokitno Szlacheckie) the labour force participation rate for osiedle na Wzgórzu 69 Rydułtowy Górne would be classified as: High.

Answer: Medium"
8,Based on its semi‐rural suburban character near Olsztyn but still within one of Poland’s lower‐participation voivodeships Ramsowo’s labour‐force participation would best be classed as Medium.
9,Answer: Medium
10,Based on its rural setting in Wąbrzeźno County (Kujawsko-Pomorskie)—comparable to other small Polish villages like Czołki (Lubelskie) or Łazy Dąbrowa (Łódzkie) which we rated “Medium”—Dębowa Łąka’s labour force participation also falls into the Medium category.
11,"Considering Barcin’s size (a small town of roughly 7 000 inhabitants in a predominantly rural county) its local economy (a mix of light industry agriculture and services) and its distance from the major employment centres of Bydgoszcz and Toruń (around 50 km) we would expect labour‐force participation here to track close to the national‐average for small towns rather than the elevated levels of larger cities or the depressed rates of very remote villages.  Against our five‐class Czech/Polish benchmark Barcin thus falls solidly into the “Medium” category.

Answer: High"
34,High

45,"Answer: High  
Rationale: Świdnica is a rural locality in Zielonogórski powiat of Lubuskie. In our benchmark the Lubuskie countryside (e.g. Bolemin Deszczno) scores “High” on labour‐force participation—above the national median but below the very highest Masovian/urban levels—so Świdnica is best classed as High."
46,Based on its location in the highly active Mazowieckie labor market (close to Płock and within commuting distance of larger employment centers) Trzepowo Nowe would fall into the “Very High” labour‐force‐participation category.
47,Based on its location in a rural part of Maków County (Mazowieckie) – a region with relatively strong labour‐market ties (commuting possibilities to mid-size towns and even Warsaw) yet without the extreme urban pull of Siedlce or Warsaw suburbs – Modzele’s labour‐force participation would be expected above the Polish rural average but not at the very top.  I therefore classify it as: High.
48,Based on its location in the Masovian Voivodeship (a generally highly active labour‐market region) and by analogy with other rural Mazovian sites (e.g. Niwiski/Mokobody rated “Very High”) Ciemno Gnojna most likely falls into the “Very High” labour‐force participation category.

51,Based on Podkarpackie’s generally below-average economic activity and labour participation (it ranks among Poland’s less developed regions) Świlcza in Rzeszowski County would fall into the “Low” class.
52,Based on its location—a small remote village in one of Poland’s less‐developed mountain‐border voivodeships with below-average workforce engagement—the labour force participation in Bełchówka is best classified as Low.
