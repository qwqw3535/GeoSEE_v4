1,Based on its location in the Pszczyński district of the highly urbanized Silesian Voivodeship and by analogy with similarly small yet well-commuter‐connected villages like Rokitno Szlacheckie (assigned “High”) Kobiór would also fall into the “High” category.
2,"Based on its location in a moderately well-developed commuter-influenced part of the Śląskie Voivodeship—and by analogy to similarly sized communities in Lubliniecki and neighboring Zawierciański counties which we’ve rated as “High”—the share of university‐educated adults in Koszęcin is best classified as:  
Answer: High"
3,"Based on its location—a small village in the Rudziniec commune of Gliwice County in the Silesian Voivodeship—and by analogy with similarly sized rural communities in Silesia and elsewhere in Poland (which generally fall into the “Medium” bracket for share of university‐educated residents) Ligota Łabędzka is best classified as:

Answer: Medium"
4,Very High
5,High
6,High
7,Based on the location’s rural setting in Podkarpackie (one of Poland’s less‐developed lower‐education provinces) and by analogy with similar districts I would classify its share of university‐educated residents as Low.

9,Low
10,Based on its rural setting in Wąbrzeski county (Kujawsko-Pomorskie) and by analogy with other Polish villages in similar provinces (which we’ve rated “Medium”) Dębowa Łąka 40 should also be classed as Medium.
11,"Based on Barcin’s profile—a small town in a predominantly rural county with no major university presence but typical levels of secondary‐school completion and some vocational training—the share of university‐educated adults is unlikely to reach the “High” threshold. By analogy with similar Polish small towns in Kujawsko‐Pomorskie and neighboring voivodeships the most fitting class is:

Answer: Medium"
12,"Based on its location in a sparsely populated forestry‐dominated part of north‐central Poland and by analogy with similar rural communes in Kuyavia‐Pomerania and neighbouring voivodeships (which we’ve classified as “Medium”) Wysoka in Gmina Cekcyn Tuchola County would also be rated:

29,Medium
30,Based on its location in the suburban/exurban belt of the Wrocław metropolitan area (Trzebnicki powiat Dolnośląskie) where a high share of residents commute into the city’s universities and professional services the share of university‐educated adults in Wisznia Mała is best classed as High.
31,Based on Wolibórz’s setting in the largely rural peripheral Kłodzki district of Dolnośląskie—an area without a major university hub and with socio‐economic characteristics closer to mountain/spa towns than to urban centres—the share of university‐educated residents is expected to fall below the national average yet above the very lowest tiers. I would therefore classify it as: Low.
32,Based on Popowice’s location as an urban quarter of Wrocław (one of Poland’s largest university and research hubs) its strong pull of students and young professionals and by analogy to Szczecin’s Dąbie district being rated “Very High” I assign Popowice Wrocław Dolnośląskie the class: Very High.
33,"Based on the patterns in the provided benchmarks—rural villages in central and eastern Poland (Łódzkie Lubelskie Lubuskie Mazowieckie) almost invariably fall into the “Medium” band for share of university‐educated residents—and given that Szczedrzyk is a small village in Gmina Ozimek (Opolskie) immediately adjacent to the regional capital Opole (which itself has a moderately educated workforce) the most consistent classification is:

Answer: Medium"
34,Medium

51,"Based on its location in the commuter belt of Rzeszów (a regional university centre) yet lying in Podkarpackie (one of Poland’s lower-tertiary‐attainment voivodeships) Świlcza’s share of university graduates is likely around the national average for rural/peripheral districts. This aligns with the “Medium” benchmark.  

Answer: Medium"
52,Low
53,Low
54,Based on its location in a small rural village within the less‐developed Lubelskie region (Polubicze Wiejskie Gmina Wisznice Bialski) where tertiary attainment rates are relatively low compared to more urbanized districts the estimated share of university‐educated residents falls into the “Low” category.
