19,"Answer: Medium

Chojno is a small village in the Gmina Wronki (Szamotulski county) of the Wielkopolskie voivodeship – a moderately prosperous primarily rural area outside larger urban centres. Based on comparable village‐level locations in Poland’s western and central regions (e.g. Rynarcice in Dolnośląskie or Ramsowo in Warmińsko‐Mazurskie both rated “Medium”) and given its distance from a major university hub the share of university‐educated residents is likely around the national rural average placing it in the “Medium” class."
