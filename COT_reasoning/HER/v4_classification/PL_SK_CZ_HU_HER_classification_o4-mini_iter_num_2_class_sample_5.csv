7,Answer: Low
8,Low
9,Based on its location in rural Świętokrzyskie (a province with below‐average tertiary attainment) and by analogy with similarly sized villages (e.g. Morawczyna in Małopolskie classified as “Low”) Rączki in Gmina Kluczewsko Włoszczowski Świętokrzyskie should be placed in the “Low” class.

29,"Based on regional socio-economic profiles Lubin County (powiat lubański) sits above the national average in tertiary‐educated share—driven by the KGHM-related workforce proximity to Wrocław’s labor market and higher incomes—yet below the largest urban centers (e.g. Wrocław Szczecin).
