Skaratki (Gmina Domaniewice Powiat Łowicki województwo łódzkie) leży w typowo rolniczym peryferyjnym obszarze centralnej Polski bez dużych ośrodków akademicko-badawczych i znaczącego rynku pracy wymagającego wyższego wykształcenia. Na podstawie porównań z podobnymi wiejskimi miejscowościami w regionach mazowieckim czy dolnośląskim (które plasowały się w klasie „Low”) odsetek osób z wykształceniem co najmniej uniwersyteckim będzie tu stosunkowo niski – stąd klasyfikacja „Low”."
