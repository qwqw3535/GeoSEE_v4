0,Based on its rural character within Ciechanowski county (Masovian Voivodeship) and comparison with similar small villages in the region we’d place Ościsłowo’s share of university‐educated residents in the “Medium” category.
1,Based on Kobiór’s location in Pszczyński powiat (a well-integrated economically strong commuter belt of the Upper Silesian metro area) its small but affluent population and the fact that most gminas on the outskirts of Katowice/Tychy exhibit above-average university attainment we would place it in the “High” category.
2,Based on the regional benchmarks and the fact that Lubliniecki (with its modest‐sized urban center of Lubliniec ~24 000 inhabitants but no large city anchor) falls between the purely rural low-education districts and the high-education city districts I’d classify its share of tertiary‐educated residents as Medium.
3,Based on its location in a peri-urban part of Gliwice County in the Silesian Voivodeship—where overall educational attainment is well above the national rural average thanks to proximity to major Silesian universities and high‐tech employers—and by analogy with other rural Silesian communities (e.g. Rokitno Szlacheckie in Zawierciański) Ligota Łabędzka would fall into the “High” class for share of university‐educated residents.
