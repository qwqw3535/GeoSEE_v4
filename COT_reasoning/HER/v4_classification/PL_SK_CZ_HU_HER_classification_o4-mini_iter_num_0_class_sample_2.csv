1,Based on the characteristics of Kobiór in Pszczyński District (a largely rural/suburban area in Śląskie Voivodeship with no major university centers and typical Polish county‐level education levels below national urban averages) it would be classified as: Low.
2,Based on its location—a small town in rural Lubliniecki County (Śląskie) away from major university centres—and by analogy with similar Polish rural districts the share of university‐educated residents is likely Low.
3,Based on its small‐village rural character in the Gliwice hinterland (Śląskie) and by analogy with other Polish villages in the dataset Ligota Łabędzka would fall into the “Low” category.

24,Based on Szczecin’s status as a mid‐sized regional capital—with significant higher‐education institutions but no flagship national university on the level of Warsaw or Prague—its share of university graduates is likely above the Polish rural/town average but below the top‐tier urban/suburban centres.  I therefore classify Dąbie 1 Szczecin as Medium.

Answer: High"
68,"Based on Bobot’s status as a small rural municipality in the Trenčín Region—where even though the region-wide tertiary‐educated share is around 20% villages of this size typically hover closer to 10–15%—it aligns with the “Low” benchmark.  
Answer: Low"

78,Based on its location in the Karlovarský region—one of the lowest in the Czech Republic for share of tertiary‐educated residents—and comparing to the provided benchmarks the expected proportion of highly educated individuals in 357 33 Loket Karlovarský CZE falls into the “Low” category.
79,"Based on Ústecký region’s below‐average share of university graduates (historically one of the less‐educated Czech regions) and the fact that Lukov is a small municipality in that area the proportion of higher‐educated residents would align with the “Low” benchmark. 

Answer: Low"
80,Based on Javorník’s location in the Liberec Region—a predominantly rural area with tertiary‐educated shares modestly above purely agricultural/localities but well below urban centres like Prague—the share of university graduates would fall into the “Medium” band.

84,"Based on Újezd’s location in the largely rural Olomoucký region—tempered by proximity to the university town of Olomouc—and comparing with similar Czech villages (e.g. Holasice Jihomoravský → Medium) the share of university‐educated residents most closely fits the “Medium” class.  
Answer: Medium"
85,"Based on the region’s socio-demographic profile Želechovice nad Dřevnicí sits in the Zlínský kraj which—while benefiting from proximity to the Tomas Bata University in nearby Zlín—still hovers around the national average share of tertiary-educated residents (roughly 15–20 %). It is neither a top‐tier agglomeration like Prague (Very High) nor one of the markedly low-education rural peripheries. Therefore the appropriate class is:
