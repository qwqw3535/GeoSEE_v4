Answer: Low"
8,Based on its being a small village in the peripheral below‐average‐education Warmian-Masurian region (albeit in the orbit of Olsztyn) Ramsowo would most plausibly fall into the “Medium” bracket for share of university graduates.
9,"Based on the remote predominantly rural character of Rączki (a small village in the Kluczewsko commune of Włoszczowski district Świętokrzyskie) and the generally below‐average tertiary‐education rates in that province it would fall below the Polish rural norm (which we have pegged at “Medium”). I therefore classify Rączki as:
