0,Based on its being a small relatively remote town in Ciechanów County (Mazowieckie) — outside the immediate Warsaw commuter belt but still in Poland’s highest-ranking education voivodeship — the share of university graduates is unlikely to be very low or very high. It best fits the “Medium” category.
1,High
2,Based on its location in a moderately‐educated region (Śląskie Voivodeship) its role as a small gmina seat and proximity to larger towns (Lubliniec Katowice) – but also its rural character – Koszęcin’s share of university‐educated residents most closely corresponds to the “Medium” benchmark.
3,Based on its small‐village rural setting in the Gliwicki district (far from major academic centres) and by analogy to similarly remote Polish localities in the reference list Ligota Łabędzka is best classified as having a Low proportion of university‐educated residents.
4,High
5,Based on its being a small village in a largely rural part of Zawiercie County (Śląskie) – despite the broader Silesian region’s relatively stronger urban education levels Rokitno Szlacheckie sits outside the main metropolitan core and resembles other Polish rural districts where tertiary-degree rates hover around the national rural median – it best fits the “Medium” category.
6,Based on Częstochowa’s profile as a mid‐sized regional city (population ~230 000) with a mix of industrial heritage and local higher‐education institutions—but lacking the very highest concentrations of graduates seen in capital‐area or major university hubs—I’d classify its share of university‐educated residents as Medium.
7,Based on Szczyrk’s profile—a small mountain resort/tourist town some distance from major urban centers with service‐oriented employment but no large local university or major corporate hub—I would place its share of university‐educated residents at around the regional average for small towns i.e. Medium.
8,Based on its profile—a small post‐industrial Silesian urban settlement within the greater Katowice conurbation but without the commuter‐belt affluence of Mazovia or Lesser Poland’s larger cities—osiedle na Wzgórzu in Rydułtowy Górne most plausibly falls into the “Medium” bracket for share of university‐educated residents.
9,"Based on its location—a small rural gmina in one of Poland’s least‐educated provinces (Podkarpackie)—the share of university‐educated residents is likely in the “Low” bracket.  
Answer: Low"
10,"Based on its rural setting in the under-developed Warmian-Masurian region yet its proximity to Olsztyn the share of university-educated residents in Ramsowo is likely below the national average but not at the very bottom.  
Answer: Low"
11,Based on its location in the largely rural lower‐development Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship and by analogy with similarly small villages in that part of Poland the share of university graduates in the Włoszczowski district is likely to fall into the “Low” category.
12,Based on the largely rural character of Dębowa Łąka (a small‐village district in Wąbrzeźno County Kujawsko-Pomorskie) its distance from major university centers and comparators from the provided benchmarks the share of university-educated residents is best classified as Low.
13,"Based on Barcin’s size (a small gmina town of ~7 000 inhabitants) its distance from major academic centers (≈40 km from Bydgoszcz/Toruń) and comparisons with similarly sized rural/semirural districts in Kujawsko-Pomorskie and neighboring voivodeships the share of university‐educated residents is likely below the national regional average but not at the very bottom.

28,Answer: Very Low
29,Based on its setting – a small rural village in the Lwówecki district of Lower Silesia (a province whose high-education rates are driven almost entirely by Wrocław and surrounding suburbs) – and by analogy to similarly structured districts like Kłodzki (Medium) Mojesz’s district would also fall into the Medium class.
30,Answer: Medium
31,High
32,Answer: Very High
33,Based on its status as a small village in the Opole region (a rural area with modest educational attainment levels despite its proximity to the town of Ozimek) the share of university‐educated residents is likely Low.
34,Medium
35,Low
36,Based on its status as a small village in Gmina Parzęczew (Zgierski powiat) – albeit within commuting distance of Łódź – Opole is still fundamentally a rural locality. Its proximity to a large city will lift educational attainment above the lowest tiers but it lacks the suburban‐commuter profile that tends to push places into “High.”  I would therefore classify Opole Parzęczew Łódzkie as Medium.
37,Very High
38,Low
39,Based on the fact that Bory Tucholskie lies in a sparsely populated largely rural part of Chojnicki (Pomorskie) with only small towns nearby and no major university‐driven urban center its share of university graduates is likely on the lower end of the national spectrum.  Answer: Low
40,Low
41,High
42,Answer: High
43,Based on its rural character (a small village in the Dębnica Kaszubska commune Słupsk County) and relative distance from major urban‐educated labour markets the share of university graduates in Ochodza is likely at the lower end of the national rural spectrum. Answer: Low.
44,Based on Netta Druga’s location in rural Podlaskie (a province with below-national-average tertiary attainment) and its small-settlement character the share of university graduates is likely in the “Low” bracket.
45,Answer: Low
46,Medium
47,Based on its location in Płock County (a mid‐sized post-industrial area in Mazowieckie with neither the very low rural profile of north Wielkopolskie nor the high-commuter belt status of Miński) the share of university-educated residents is best classed as Medium.

52,Answer: Medium
53,Based on its location in the hinterland of Rzeszów (a regional-capital labor and education hub) yet within one of Poland’s less‐affluent provinces Świlcza’s share of university-educated residents would most plausibly fall into the “Medium” category.
54,Answer: Low
55,Answer: Medium
56,Low
57,Answer: High
58,Based on the location’s being in a predominantly rural Lubelskie district (Puławski powiat) and by analogy with similar Lubelskie examples (e.g. Czołki in Zamojski – Medium) the share of university‐educated residents is best classified as: Medium.
59,Answer: Medium
60,Based on its location in the Kraków commuter belt (Gmina Krzeszowice Krakowski powiat Małopolskie) – a fairly well-educated suburban/rural fringe with strong links to the Kraków labour market – the share of university graduates is expected to exceed typical rural or small‐town levels but not rival inner‐city Kraków.  I therefore assign it to the “High” class.
61,Based on its rural‐tourist profile in southern Małopolska—comparable to similarly sized non‐urban districts like Kłodzki or Nowosądecki—I would assign Morawczyna (Nowotarski) a “Medium” level of highly educated residents.
62,High
63,High
64,Very High
65,Based on its location in the immediate suburban catchment of Warsaw (Warszawski Zachodni) – a high‐income well-connected commuter belt with above-average educational attainment – I would classify Ołtarzew as Very High.

90,Based on Városlőd’s small‐village setting in a mid‐rank Hungarian county (Veszprém) its likely below‐average share of university graduates and comparing it to the given regional benchmarks the proportion of highly educated residents in Városlőd is best classified as: Low.
91,Answer: Medium
92,Based on Sorkifalud’s rural character—even though it lies in relatively developed Vas County away from major hubs like Győr—and comparing it to similar-size settlements in Western Transdanubia and our Czech/Polish benchmarks its share of university‐educated residents most plausibly falls into the “Medium” category.
93,Answer: Medium
94,Based on its location within the university city of Pécs (Pécsi járás Baranya) which boosts the local share of tertiary‐educated residents above the rural Hungarian average but remains below Budapest’s levels I would classify Málom’s proportion of highly educated individuals as: High.
95,Very Low

Answer: Medium"
100,Answer: Low
101,Based on its location in a predominantly rural below-average educational‐attainment county (Bács-Kiskun) and comparing to the Hungarian “Very Low” case (Nógrád) and the national average Közép-Tiszai Tájvédelmi Körzet (Tiszakécske) is best placed in the “Low” category.
102,Low
103,Based on Murony’s location in Békés county – a below‐average largely rural area in the Southern Great Plain with tertiary attainment figures notably under the national mean (but above the lowest‐ranked counties like Nógrád) – the share of university‐educated residents would best be classified as Low.
104,Based on Hódmezővásárhely’s size as a provincial county seat (≈45 000 inhabitants) its regional university presence and benchmarking against similar Hungarian towns the share of university‐educated residents is best judged as: Medium.
