49,"Based on its size and regional role (a mid‐sized city of around 220 000 in Mazowieckie) and comparing to similar‐scale cities like Częstochowa (High) versus larger metropolises (Very High) Radom’s share of university‐educated residents most closely aligns with the “High” benchmark.  
Answer: High"
50,Based on its location—a small village in the largely rural Świętokrzyskie region—and by analogy with similar Polish rural districts (which nearly all fall into the Low‐education bracket) I would classify Gruszka Zagnańsk Kielecki Świętokrzyskie as having a Low proportion of university-educated residents.
51,High
52,Based on its location in a sparsely populated rural part of Podkarpackie Voivodeship (Sanok County) – an area with below‐average higher‐education attainment in Poland – the share of university‐educated residents in Bełchówka would align with the “Low” benchmark.
