0,Based on its rural setting in Ciechanowski county (a small‐town/peripheral area of Mazowieckie) and comparing to similar gminas in the region the share of university-educated residents is likely in the Low category. Answer: Low
1,High
2,Answer: High
3,High
4,Based on Brynów‐Osiedle Zgrzebnioka’s location in Katowice – a major regional capital with a large student population (University of Silesia and other higher-ed institutions) a strong service and tech sector and generally above-average educational attainment in the Upper Silesian metropolitan area – the share of university‐educated residents is best classed as Very High.
5,Medium
6,Based on the local context (a small post‐industrial Silesian town rather than a major university centre) and by analogy with similarly sized Polish towns in the examples above the share of university‐educated residents in Rydułtowy Górne is best classified as Medium.
7,Based on its location in the largely rural economically under-developed Jarosławski district of Podkarpackie – a province with one of the lowest tertiary‐education rates in Poland – ulica Wietlin in Laszki is likely below the national average share of university graduates. In our Polish examples even comparable small villages in poorer regions never fell into the “Very Low” bucket so the most fitting class here is: Low.
8,Low
9,Low
10,Based on its profile as a small rural seat of gmina in Kujawsko-Pomorskie—akin to other non-industrial villages classified as “Medium” in Łódzkie Lubelskie or Lubuskie—and given its moderate access to larger academic centres (Bydgoszcz/Toruń) but lack of a strong local university presence Dębowa Łąka’s share of university‐educated residents is best classed as Medium.
11,"Based on Barcin’s profile—a small industry‐light town in a predominantly rural county of Kujawsko-Pomorskie with reasonable access to larger urban centers but without a major university presence—its share of university graduates is likely in the mid‐range compared to these benchmarks.  
Answer: Medium"

Answer: Medium"
13,High
14,Based on its rural character within Kujawsko-pomorskie and by analogy with similar villages in other Polish provinces (which tend to fall into the Medium category) the share of university-educated residents in Wieniec Zalesie is best classified as: Medium.
15,Based on its rural character yet location in the relatively prosperous Wielkopolskie voivodeship (and by analogy to similarly sized villages in good‐performing provinces which tend to cluster in the middle tier) Daninów Kazimierz Biskupi Koniński Wielkopolskie POL would be classified as Medium.
16,Based on its location in a small rural gmina (Kaczory) within Piła County in the generally well-educated but still predominantly agricultural Wielkopolskie region the share of university-educated residents in Dziembowo would most closely align with the “Medium” benchmark.

Relative to our benchmarks this corresponds to a Medium level of highly educated individuals.  Answer: Medium
21,Based on its location—a small village in the Grodziski county of Wielkopolskie within commuting distance of Poznań but still essentially rural—and by analogy with similar Polish districts (e.g. Łazy Dąbrowa or Bolemin which we rated “Medium”) Kotusz most plausibly falls into the “Medium” category for the share of university‐educated residents.

25,High
26,"Based on Bonin’s profile—a small tourism‐and‐service‐oriented village near Kołobrzeg rather than a large urban or academic center—the share of university‐educated residents is likely below the national average. 

Answer: Low"
27,Based on Podlaskie’s relatively low tertiary‐education rates—especially in small agricultural gminas like Nowe Piekuty—and by analogy with similarly remote Polish villages (e.g. Morawczyna = Low) Łopienie-Zyski falls into the “Low” class.
28,Answer: Low
29,Based on its location in the largely rural gmina Rudna (Lubiński district Dolnośląskie) – a mid‐sized mining region with moderate—but not top‐tier—tertiary attainment Rynarcice would most closely align with the “Medium” benchmark.

32,Very High
33,Based on its location—a small village in the Opolskie region which overall lags national averages but is comparable to other rural districts that we’ve rated as “Medium”—the share of university‐educated residents in Szczedrzyk (Ozimek Opolski) is best classified as Medium.
34,"Based on Łambinowice’s location in Nysa County (a largely rural/p small‐town district in Opolskie with average access to higher-ed institutions) and by analogy with similarly structured Polish powiats (e.g. Gorzowski Zamojski Piotrkowski all rated “Medium”) the share of university‐educated residents in Nyski is best classified as:  
Answer: Medium"
35,Medium
36,Based on Zgierski’s mix of suburban areas around Łódź (with easy access to universities) and its own small‐town centers its share of university‐educated residents is above the national‐rural average but not as high as a major metro.  I therefore assign it to the “High” class.
37,Answer: Very High
38,Based on its location in a predominantly rural Łowicki powiat (similar in character to Piotrkowski or Zamojski powiats which were benchmarked at “Medium”) and its distance from major academic centres the share of university‐educated adults in Skaratki (Domaniewice Łowicki Łódzkie) is best classified as Medium.
39,Low
40,Answer: Medium
41,Very High
42,Based on Warzno’s location in the commuter belt of the Gdańsk–Gdynia–Sopot metropolitan area (Pomorskie Voivodeship) its relatively affluent outward-growing suburban character and higher-than-rural average income/education levels I would classify its share of university-educated residents as: High.
43,Medium
44,"Based on Netta Druga’s location in a largely rural lower‐GDP part of Podlaskie (with small‐town/tourist Augustów nearby) and by analogy to similarly sized Polish villages in Małopolskie (Morawczyna → Low) the share of university graduates is likely in the “Low” bracket. 

Final Answer: Low"
45,Based on its location in the mostly rural Zielonogórski district (surrounding the regional city of Zielona Góra) and by analogy to similarly situated Lubuskie communities (e.g. Bolemin – Medium) Świdnica’s share of university‐educated residents is best classified as Medium.
46,"Based on its location in a predominantly rural gmina just outside Płock (a regional rather than a metropolitan centre) Trzepowo Nowe’s share of university‐educated residents is likely comparable to other medium-density non-suburban areas in Poland.  

Final answer: Medium"
47,Based on its position in a predominantly rural small‐town district north of Warsaw—and by analogy to other central‐Mazovian and rural Polish counties that we’ve rated as “Medium”—the share of university‐educated residents in Makowski (Modzele Młynarze) most closely corresponds to a Medium level.
48,"Based on the fact that Ciemno Gnojna lies in Żyrardowski (a Mazowieckie district with close economic ties to Warsaw) its mixed small‐town and commuter‐belt character and by analogy with similarly placed Mazovian gminas (e.g. Mokobody/Siedlecki rated “High”) I’d assign:  
Answer: High"
49,Answer: High
50,Based on its location in the largely rural Kielecki county (excluding the city of Kielce) – a region with moderate access to a mid‐sized university town but overall below‐average regional education levels – the share of university graduates in Gruszka Zagnańsk (Kielecki Świętokrzyskie) is best classed as Medium.
51,Based on Świlcza’s proximity to Rzeszów (a regional university‐city) its role as a commuter gmina and the generally higher educational pull of the urban centre yet set within the somewhat lower‐attainment Podkarpackie region the share of university-educated residents would best be classed as High.

75,"Based on the location’s rural setting in a district (Nový Jičín) of the Moravskoslezský kraj—which has one of the lowest regional shares of tertiary-educated residents in the Czech Republic (roughly 10–12 % well below the national average)—and by analogy to similarly small villages in Pardubický kraj (e.g. Bučina → Very Low) we would also classify Výškovice u Slatiny as:

83,Based on its location in the South‐Moravian Region (Jihomoravský kraj) which benefits from the strong university presence in Brno and an overall above‐average tertiary‐education share even a small village like Holasice will tend to mirror the region’s relatively high proportion of graduates.  I therefore classify it as High.
84,Based on its having one of the country’s major universities (Palacký University in Olomouc) and a higher‐than‐average share of graduates relative to most non‐metropolitan regions (though still below Prague and Brno) Olomoucký kraj would fall into the “High” category for proportion of university‐educated residents.
