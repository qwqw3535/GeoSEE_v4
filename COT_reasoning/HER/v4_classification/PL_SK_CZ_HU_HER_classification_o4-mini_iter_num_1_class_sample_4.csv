Answer: Low"
3,Low
4,Based on its location in a major urban university and industrial hub (Katowice Śląskie) and comparing with the benchmarks (city‐suburban districts in Poland tend to rank High) I would assign: High.
5,Based on its location—a small village in the Zawierciański district (a predominantly rural/suburban area outside the main urban cores of Silesia) and by analogy with other similar Polish ‘district’-level benchmarks (e.g. rural localities around Radom or Lubin rated “Low”)—we would class Rokitno Szlacheckie’s share of university-educated residents as Low.
6,Low
7,Medium
8,Based on its location—an urban‐suburban district of Rydułtowy in the densely populated industrialized Silesian metro area with reasonably good access to higher-education institutions but not being a major regional capital—the share of university‐educated residents is best classified as Medium.

11,Based on its rural character small population size and distance from major academic centres (Toruń/Bydgoszcz) Dębowa Łąka is likely below the voivodeship’s average tertiary‐education rate – corresponding to the “Low” class. Answer: Low
12,Low
13,Answer: Low
14,"Based on its location in a rural-suburban gmina just outside Toruń—with a fair share of commuters to the nearby universities and research jobs but still retaining mostly village-scale settlement patterns—the share of university-educated residents in Toporzysko is likely around the regional average rather than at city-centre levels.  I would classify it as:

25,"Based on its status as a small fairly remote rural village in Drawsko Pomorskie (far from major university centres) and comparing with similarly sized Polish localities (which tend to fall into the “Low” bracket) we would infer a “Low” share of university‐educated residents.  
Answer: Low"
26,Based on its location in the moderately urbanized Goleniów gmina (a mid‐sized town in the Szczecin metro area) and comparing to the five qualitative benchmarks the share of university‐educated residents in the “ulica Bolechowo 72-131 Goleniów gmina Goleniowski Zachodniopomorskie” area is best classed as Medium.
27,Based on its status as a small village in the hinterland of Koszalin (a regional centre with a university) – but still essentially rural – Bonin’s share of university‐educated residents is likely above the purely “Low”‐educated hamlets yet below major urban districts. It therefore best fits the “Medium” class.

30,Medium
31,Based on the profile of Wolibórz—a small village in the Kłodzki district of Dolnośląskie—and comparing it to similar rural communities in Lower Silesia (e.g. Rynarcice in Lubiński rated “Low”) we would place its share of university‐educated residents in the “Low” category.

56,Answer: High
57,"Based on Czołki’s location – a small rural village in Sitno gmina (Zamojski powiat) of the Lubelskie Voivodeship an area with below‐average higher‐education attainment and no major urban center nearby – the share of university graduates is likely similar to other Polish villages classed as “Low.”  

Answer: Low"
58,Low
59,Based on the characteristics of Mościce (an industrial‐historical district of Tarnów in Małopolskie) its urban setting but not being a major academic or service hub I would place its share of university‐educated residents in the “Medium” category.
60,Based on its small‐village character but relatively close (∼25 km) commuter access to Kraków Ostrężnica’s share of university‐educated adults is likely moderate—putting it in the Medium class.
61,Answer: Medium
62,Based on its small‐village character in a relatively peripheral non‐university district of Nowotarski (Małopolskie) Morawczyna would be expected to have a Low proportion of university‐educated residents.
63,Based on Małopolskie’s overall stronger educational profile but recognizing that Kwaczała is a small semi‐rural village in Chrzanowski county (outside the Kraków metro core) where university‐level attainment tends to lag the provincial average the share of graduates is likely in the 15–20% range.  Qualitatively that corresponds to the “Low” category.
64,Very High
65,"Based on its rural character but proximity to Warsaw (a strong commuter belt) and comparing it to other Mazovian locations (e.g. Mokobody – “Low” Ramsowo – “Medium”) we’d expect Kąty Goździejewskie to sit in the middle.  
Answer: Medium"
66,Based on its location in the Warsaw suburban belt (Ołtarzew lies in Warszawski Zachodni county of Mazowieckie just west of the capital) the community is strongly tied into the Warsaw labor market and attracts a commuting relatively well-educated population. Thus the share of university‐educated residents would be above average for Poland though a notch below the central Warsaw districts. Final classification: High.
67,Answer: Very High
68,Medium
69,Based on Trenčín’s regional profile – a mix of one medium‐sized city (Trenčín) and surrounding rural communities – its share of tertiary‐educated residents sits around the national average.  It therefore falls into the “Medium” class.
70,Very Low
71,Based on its location—a small village in the rural Dolný Kubín district of the Žilina region where tertiary‐educated shares are well below the national average—I would classify Žaškov’s proportion of highly educated residents as Low.
72,Very Low
73,Answer: Very Low
74,Based on its location in a large Slovak city (Košice) – with nearby universities and a generally higher‐than‐rural baseline – but noting that Južné Mesto is a peripheral socialist‐era housing estate rather than a central highly‐affluent district the share of university‐educated residents is best classed as Medium.
75,Based on Prague’s status as the nation’s capital and its exceptionally high share of university‐educated residents the correct class for Magnitogorská 101 00 Praha 10 Hlavní město Praha is: Very High.

81,Based on its small rural setting in the Liberecký kraj (a district‐level village with limited local tertiary‐education opportunities) and by comparison with other similar Czech localities Javorník 35 Proseč pod Ještědem most plausibly falls into the “Very Low” class for share of university‐educated residents.
82,Based on its size economic profile and the absence of a major university Dvůr Králové nad Labem would fall into the “Very Low” category for the share of university‐educated residents.
83,Low
84,Based on the fact that Jihomoravský kraj (South Moravia) is one of the stronger regions in the Czech Republic in terms of higher‐education attainment (second only to Prague/Central Bohemia) I would place Holasice’s region in the “High” class.
85,Answer: Very Low
86,Based on the fact that Želechovice nad Dřevnicí is a small commuter‐village on the outskirts of the regional centre Zlín—with better access to higher‐education jobs than more remote Czech villages but well below the big metropolitan hubs—I would classify the share of university‐educated adults here as Medium.
87,Very High
88,Based on Gyömrő’s status as a well-connected suburban town in Pest County (a commuter belt around Budapest) with higher-than–rural‐average education levels (many residents working or studying in the capital) it would be placed in the “High” category for share of university graduates.
89,Based on Seregélyes’s status as a small commuter settlement in Fejér – one of Hungary’s more economically advanced counties with a tertiary‐education share around or just above the national average (~18–19 %) – yet still a rural locality whose local rate will lag behind the county centre I would place its proportion of university‐educated residents in the “Medium” bracket.
