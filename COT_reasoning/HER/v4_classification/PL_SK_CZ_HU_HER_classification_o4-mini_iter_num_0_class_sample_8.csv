2,Based on its small‐town predominantly rural character in Lubliniecki County (Śląskie) and comparing to other Polish countryside locations (many of which fell into the “Very Low” or “Low” bands) but noting Silesia’s somewhat stronger educational profile than say eastern voivodeships Koszęcin most plausibly falls into the “Low” class.
3,"Based on its small‐village character in a largely rural part of the Gliwice area (without the strong suburban/commuter profile seen around Warsaw or Prague) Ligota Łabędzka’s share of university-educated residents would be expected to fall below the national rural average but above the most remote least-educated districts. In line with our five‐class benchmarks the most appropriate label is  
Low."

5,Based on its setting—a small village in Gmina Łazy Zawierciański (a largely rural part of Śląskie outside the main Katowice-Tychy conurbation)—we’d expect a below-average share of university graduates.  In the provided five-class scheme Rokitno Szlacheckie falls into the “Low” category.

26,Based on its proximity to Szczecin (a major university city) the presence of a mid‐sized county town (Goleniów) and commuting links—but without the ultra-high educational pull of a capital agglomeration—I assess Goleniowski (Zachodniopomorskie) at the “Medium” level.

41,"Przymorze Małe is an urban neighbourhood in Gdańsk – one of Poland’s three principal cities – with a dense concentration of students young professionals and higher-paid service-sector workers. While it doesn’t reach the absolute top tier you’d expect in a capital’s most elite quarters (Very High) its share of university-educated residents is well above the national average and even above that of many suburban locales. 

Answer: High"
42,Medium
43,"Based on its rural character (a small village in the Słupsk hinterland) and relatively limited local access to higher‐education institutions (despite being within commuting distance of Słupsk) the share of university graduates in Ochodza is likely below the national average but not at the very bottom. 
Answer: Low"

82,Based on its location in the moderately educated Pardubice Region and the fact that Bučina is a small rural settlement (so its university‐educated share will sit below the regional average of ~14 %) it falls into the “Low” category.
83,"Based on its location in the Vysočina Region (a predominantly rural‐small-town area with only one mid-sized regional centre Jihlava and no major universities beyond a regional polytechnic college) Velký Beranov’s share of university graduates is likely around the national/regional average rather than at either extreme.  Therefore the most appropriate class is:

Medium"
84,Based on its location in a rural part of Olomoucký kraj (with no immediate proximity to a major city centre like Olomouc itself) the share of tertiary‐educated residents is likely below the national/regional average but above the very lowest tier seen in the most remote villages.

93,"Answer: Very Low  
Söjtör is a small rural village in Zala County—a region whose higher‐education attainment rates lie well below the national Hungarian average. Similar rural settlements in Hungary (e.g. Nógrádsipek Zalaegerszeg környéke) fall into the “Very Low” category for share of university graduates. Given its demographic and economic profile Söjtör’s proportion of highly educated residents would likewise be classified as Very Low."
