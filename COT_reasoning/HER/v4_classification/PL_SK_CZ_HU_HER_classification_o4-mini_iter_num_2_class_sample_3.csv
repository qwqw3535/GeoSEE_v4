33,"Based on its position as a small village in the Opolskie Voivodeship (a largely rural area with moderate access to nearby Opole) and comparing to the other Polish “rural + small-town” examples (where most fell into Medium some into High only when closer to big urban centres) I would classify ulica Cmentarna 17 46-042 Szczedrzyk Ozimek Opolski Opolskie as:

Answer: Medium"

Answer: High"
35,Answer: High

45,High
46,"Based on its location – a small village in the Płock district of Mazowieckie (a relatively well-off centrally positioned voivodeship with good access to higher-education centers) – Trzepowo Nowe is likely to have a higher share of university graduates than a typical rural hinterland.

51,High
52,Based on its location in a small mountainous settlement in the Podkarpackie voivodeship (the least affluent and lowest‐tertiary‐attainment region in Poland) Bełchówka is likely below the national rural average for university‐educated residents.  I therefore assign it to the “Medium” class.
53,Answer: High
54,Medium

High"

64,Answer: High
65,Answer: Very High
66,Based on Trnava’s status as a regional university centre with above-average economic development (second only to Bratislava in Slovakia) and comparing it to the other benchmarks the share of university-educated residents in Trnava Region most closely corresponds to the “High” class.
67,Based on the fact that Bobot lies in the Trenčín Region—which while not as highly‐educated as Bratislava still posts tertiary‐attainment rates around the low‐to‐mid-20 percent range—and allowing for a modest rural drag the share of university graduates is best classed as Medium.
68,Low
69,Answer: Low
70,Based on Mýtna’s very small rural character in the Lučenec district of the Banská Bystrica region—an area with below‐national‐average tertiary attainment—and by analogy to similarly rural Slovak and Czech localities the share of university graduates is best classified as Very Low.

74,Very High
75,Based on the Moravskoslezský kraj’s overall industrial profile its below‐average share of tertiary‐educated residents (relative even to other Czech regions) and the fact that Pardubický kraj already falls into “Very Low” I would place Výškovice u Slatiny (as part of Moravskoslezský kraj) into the “Low” category.
76,Low
77,Low
78,Very Low
79,"Based on the fact that Lukov is a small municipality in the Ústecký region—one of the Czech Republic’s less economically developed areas with below‐average tertiary attainment—and comparing it to the qualitative benchmarks (where regions with roughly 10–14 % university graduates fall into the “Low” category) the share of highly educated residents in Lukov is best classified as:

Answer: Low"
80,Based on the fact that Liberecký kraj overall hovers around the national average for tertiary‐educated residents (neither among the lowest regions like Pardubický nor near Prague’s levels) and given Javorník’s rural setting within that mid‐range region the share of university‐educated adults is best classed as Medium.
81,Based on its size economic profile and the fact that Královéhradecký kraj sits around the Czech‐average for tertiary attainment (well below Prague but above the poorest regions) I’d place Dvůr Králové nad Labem in the “Medium” category.
82,Low
83,Based on its location in the South Moravian Region (which is boosted by Brno’s universities and R&D economy) but recognizing Holasice itself is a small‐village setting its share of university-educated residents would hover around the national average.  That points to the “Medium” class.
84,Low
85,High
86,Based on the socioeconomic profile of Budapest’s 10th district—an urban but historically working‐class area with a below–city‐average share of university graduates—I would place Népliget 10. kerület in the “Medium” class.
87,High
88,Based on Seregélyes’s location in Fejér (a mid‐ranking fairly industrialized county with good road links to Székesfehérvár and even Budapest) and comparing its likely tertiary‐degree share (roughly in the high-teens to low-twenties percent) against the regional benchmarks the proportion of university graduates there would be classified as Medium.
89,High

92,"Based on Sorkifalud’s location in Vas county – a relatively developed West‐Transdanubian rural area with easy access to the university city Szombathely – we’d expect the share of tertiary‐educated adults to hover around the county average (roughly 15–18 %). That puts it squarely in the “Medium” bracket.  

Answer: Medium"
93,Based on Söjtör’s location – a small rural village in Zala county (a less‐developed largely agricultural part of Western Transdanubia with no major university center) – yet still better off than Hungary’s poorest eastern counties I would place its share of university‐educated residents in the “Medium” category.
94,High

In the five‐class scheme this corresponds to:  
Answer: Medium"
101,Based on the county‐level data for Bács‐Kiskun (Southern Great Plain) which lags behind the national average in tertiary‐degree attainment and is broadly comparable to other lower‐educated Hungarian counties we would classify its share of university graduates as Low.
102,Based on Soltvadkert’s location in a largely rural agri‐industrial part of Bács-Kiskun (where tertiary graduation rates hover just under the national average of ~20%) and given that small towns typically trail their county seats Soltvadkert’s share of university‐educated residents is best classed as Medium.
103,Based on the county’s overall educational profile—Békés being part of Hungary’s less‐urbanized Great Plain with below‐average tertiary attainment—the share of university graduates would be classified as: Low.
