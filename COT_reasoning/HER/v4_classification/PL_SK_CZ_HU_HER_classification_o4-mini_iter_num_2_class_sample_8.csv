14,Based on its location—a small village within commuting distance of Włocławek in the relatively well‐connected Kujawsko‐Pomorskie province—and by analogy with the other Polish “rural but near a mid-sized urban center” examples (Łazy Dąbrowa Czołki Bolemin Rokitno Szlacheckie etc.) Wieniec Zalesie’s share of university-educated residents is best classed as High.
