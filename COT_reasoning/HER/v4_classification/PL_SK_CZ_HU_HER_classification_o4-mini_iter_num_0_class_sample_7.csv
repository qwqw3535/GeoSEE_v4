18,Based on its rural setting in Szamotuły County (a predominantly agricultural area) and by analogy with other small Wielkopolska villages in your benchmarks Chojno would be classified as: Low
19,Answer: Low
20,Based on its location—a small village in the Białostocki district of the relatively less-affluent Podlaskie province yet within the commuter belt of the city of Białystok—the share of university‐educated residents is likely modest but above the very lowest levels seen in more remote rural areas.  I would therefore classify Studzianki’s proportion of highly-educated individuals as Medium.
21,Based on its setting as a small rural village in the Grodzisk Wielkopolski district of Wielkopolskie—similar in profile to Dziembowo and Daninów which were both rated “Low”—we would classify Kotusz’s share of university‐educated residents as Low.
22,Low
23,"Based on its location – a small rural village in the economically weaker Warmińsko-mazurskie region – and by comparison with similar Polish rural localities (which all fell into the “Low” bracket) Majdany Wielkie would likewise be classified as:  
Answer: Low"
24,"Answer: High

Rationale: Dąbie is a district within Szczecin the capital of Zachodniopomorskie and a significant academic hub (University of Szczecin West Pomeranian University of Technology Medical University of Szczecin Maritime University etc.). While not on the same scale as Prague or Warsaw Szczecin’s sizable student population and concentration of higher-education institutions drive a well-above-average share of university graduates. This aligns with our “High” benchmark (e.g. commuter suburbs of Warsaw) rather than the “Medium” seen in more rural areas or smaller towns."

39,Answer: Low
40,Based on its location in the largely rural Tczew district (Pomorskie voivodeship)—which mixes a small urban centre (Tczew) with many villages—and comparing to the qualitative benchmarks Szprudowo’s district‐level share of tertiary‐educated residents would be classified as: Medium.
41,Based on Przymorze Małe’s location within the Tri-City’s urban core its proximity to major universities (University of Gdańsk Gdańsk University of Technology) and the generally higher share of white-collar and student populations in this neighborhood the proportion of university‐educated residents is best classed as “High.”
42,Based on Warzno’s location in the prosperous highly connected Tricity hinterland of Pomorskie – a rural village whose residents largely commute into the Gdańsk–Gdynia–Sopot metropolitan labor market – educational attainment should be elevated compared to more remote Polish countryside. By analogy with other commuter‐belt communities (e.g. Dębe Wielkie in Mazowieckie which was rated High) Warzno merits a classification of: High.

44,Low
45,Low
46,Based on its location – a small village in the rural part of Zielonogórski county (Lubuskie is one of Poland’s less‐urbanized lower‐income voivodeships with relatively few university graduates) – the share of highly educated residents in Świdnica is likely Low.
47,Based on its location in a predominantly rural gmina just outside the city of Płock (a mid‐sized regional center) and by analogy with similar rural‐near‐smaller‐city districts (e.g. Czołki/Zamojski=Medium) I would classify Trzepowo Nowe Stara Biała Płocki Mazowieckie as: Medium.

51,Answer: Medium
52,Based on its rural character but close commuting links to the university town of Kielce (Jan Kochanowski University) – and by analogy to similarly sized villages near mid‐sized Polish cities (e.g. Czołki near Zamość classified as Medium) – Gruszka Zagnańsk Kielecki Świętokrzyskie would be best placed in the Medium class.
53,Low
54,Based on its location in a sparsely populated predominantly rural county of Podkarpackie (one of Poland’s less urbanized and lower‐development regions) and by analogy with similarly sized villages in Łódzkie Dolnośląskie or Wielkopolskie (all of which we classified as “Low”) the share of university‐educated residents in Bełchówka is best placed in the “Low” category.
55,Based on the socio-economic profile of Mielecki County (a largely rural agriculture-oriented area in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship with only one mid-sized industrial town and overall below-national-average tertiary attainment) the share of university-educated residents would fall into the “Low” bucket.
56,Based on its rural setting in Lubelskie (well removed from major university centres) and by analogy with similar Polish villages (excluding the few near Zamość that we pegged at Medium) I’d classify Polubicze Wiejskie as Low.

58,Answer: Low
59,"Based on the location being an industrial‐era district of a mid-sized city (Tarnów) without a major university campus or large professional services sector—and by analogy to similarly sized Małopolskie towns like Nowy Sącz which we’ve rated “Low”—we would classify Mościce’s share of university graduates as:

Answer: Low"
60,Based on its status as a small village in the Kraków-adjacent Krakowski district (a largely rural area that nonetheless lies within commuting distance of a major university city) Ostrężnica’s share of university‐educated residents is likely above the typical “Low” rural baseline but not on par with suburban Warsaw or Prague.  I would therefore classify it as Medium.
61,Based on the largely rural character of Morawczyna within Nowy Targ County—away from major academic centers and exhibiting demographic and economic profiles similar to other small Polish villages—I would classify its share of university‐educated residents as Low.
62,Low
63,Answer: Very High
64,Based on its location within Warsaw (one of Poland’s strongest higher‐education hubs) Praga-Południe would fall into the “High” category for the share of university‐educated residents.
65,Based on its location in the commuter-belt of Warsaw (Warszawski Zachodni Mazowieckie) – an area with a strong influx of university-educated professionals – Ołtarzew would fall into the “High” category.
66,Answer: Very High
67,"Based on the fact that Trnava is a mid‐sized regional capital (≈65 000 inhabitants) hosts a classical university but sits well below the capital‐region’s very high tertiary‐attainment rates and given its region’s estimated share of graduates (~13 % – 14 %) is only modestly above the Slovak average it falls into the “Medium” bracket.

75,Based on the Moravskoslezský region’s historically industrial profile (lower tertiary‐education share than Prague or Brno) but still hosting a major university in Ostrava the proportion of university‐educated residents in Výškovice u Slatiny is best classified as Medium.
76,Low
77,"Based on its being a small municipality in the largely rural Plzeň region (and by analogy to Holasice in Jihomoravský which we rated “Medium”) you’d expect Bolkov’s share of tertiary‐educated residents to fall squarely in the medium bracket. 

Answer: Medium"
78,Answer: Medium
79,Based on the Ústecký region’s relatively low share of tertiary‐educated residents compared both to the national average and to regions like Prague or South Moravia I would classify it as Low.
80,Based on its being a small fairly remote village in the Liberec region—yet still within the Czech Republic’s generally higher‐than‐Poland/Hungary baseline for tertiary education—the share of university‐educated residents would most likely fall into the Medium category.
81,"Answer: Medium

Dvůr Králové nad Labem is a midsize district town (≈16 000 inhabitants) in Královéhradecký kraj. It is neither a major university hub (like Praha or Brno) nor a small rural village. Education levels here typically align with regional averages for the Hradec Region. Hence the proportion of university‐educated residents is best classified as “Medium.”"
82,Based on the location in a moderately urbanized non‐metropolitan region (Pardubický kraj) with tertiary‐education rates below Prague but around the Czech average the proportion of university graduates would classify as: Medium.
83,Low
84,Answer: Medium
85,Based on its location in the Zlín Region—which ranks below the Czech average in share of tertiary‐educated residents—and the fact that Želechovice nad Dřevnicí is a small suburban village (close to the city of Zlín and its technical university but still outside the main urban core) the proportion of university graduates here is likely around regional norms.  Against our five‐class benchmarks that points to a “Medium” share of highly educated individuals.  Answer: Medium
